The Myth of Artificial Intelligence,Erik J. Larson,"“Exposes the vast gap between the actual science underlying AI and the dramatic claims being made for it.” —John Horgan “If you want to know about AI, read this book...It shows how a supposedly futuristic reverence for Artificial Intelligence retards progress when it denigrates our most irreplaceable resource for any future progress: our own human intelligence.” —Peter Thiel Ever since Alan Turing, AI enthusiasts have equated artificial intelligence with human intelligence. A computer scientist working at the forefront of natural language processing, Erik Larson takes us on a tour of the landscape of AI to reveal why this is a profound mistake. AI works on inductive reasoning, crunching data sets to predict outcomes. But humans don’t correlate data sets. We make conjectures, informed by context and experience. And we haven’t a clue how to program that kind of intuitive reasoning, which lies at the heart of common sense. Futurists insist AI will soon eclipse the capacities of the most gifted mind, but Larson shows how far we are from superintelligence—and what it would take to get there. “Larson worries that we’re making two mistakes at once, defining human intelligence down while overestimating what AI is likely to achieve...Another concern is learned passivity: our tendency to assume that AI will solve problems and our failure, as a result, to cultivate human ingenuity.” —David A. Shaywitz, Wall Street Journal “A convincing case that artificial general intelligence—machine-based intelligence that matches our own—is beyond the capacity of algorithmic machine learning because there is a mismatch between how humans and machines know what they know.” —Sue Halpern, New York Review of Books",Computers,,,321.0,2021-04-06,http://books.google.com/books?id=GzQXEAAAQBAJ&dq=artificial+intelligence&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,artificial intelligence,Beginner,Theory
Affect and Artificial Intelligence,Elizabeth A. Wilson,"In 1950, Alan Turing, the British mathematician, cryptographer, and computer pioneer, looked to the future: now that the conceptual and technical parameters for electronic brains had been established, what kind of intelligence could be built? Should machine intelligence mimic the abstract thinking of a chess player or should it be more like the developing mind of a child? Should an intelligent agent only think, or should it also learn, feel, and grow? Affect and Artificial Intelligence is the first in-depth analysis of affect and intersubjectivity in the computational sciences. Elizabeth Wilson makes use of archival and unpublished material from the early years of AI (1945–70) until the present to show that early researchers were more engaged with questions of emotion than many commentators have assumed. She documents how affectivity was managed in the canonical works of Walter Pitts in the 1940s and Turing in the 1950s, in projects from the 1960s that injected artificial agents into psychotherapeutic encounters, in chess-playing machines from the 1940s to the present, and in the Kismet (sociable robotics) project at MIT in the 1990s.",Computers,,,197.0,2011-03-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kf_ohc2z3BUC&source=gbs_api,artificial intelligence,Advanced,Theory
The Promise of Artificial Intelligence,Brian Cantwell Smith,"An argument that—despite dramatic advances in the field—artificial intelligence is nowhere near developing systems that are genuinely intelligent. In this provocative book, Brian Cantwell Smith argues that artificial intelligence is nowhere near developing systems that are genuinely intelligent. Second wave AI, machine learning, even visions of third-wave AI: none will lead to human-level intelligence and judgment, which have been honed over millennia. Recent advances in AI may be of epochal significance, but human intelligence is of a different order than even the most powerful calculative ability enabled by new computational capacities. Smith calls this AI ability “reckoning,” and argues that it does not lead to full human judgment—dispassionate, deliberative thought grounded in ethical commitment and responsible action. Taking judgment as the ultimate goal of intelligence, Smith examines the history of AI from its first-wave origins (“good old-fashioned AI,” or GOFAI) to such celebrated second-wave approaches as machine learning, paying particular attention to recent advances that have led to excitement, anxiety, and debate. He considers each AI technology's underlying assumptions, the conceptions of intelligence targeted at each stage, and the successes achieved so far. Smith unpacks the notion of intelligence itself—what sort humans have, and what sort AI aims at. Smith worries that, impressed by AI's reckoning prowess, we will shift our expectations of human intelligence. What we should do, he argues, is learn to use AI for the reckoning tasks at which it excels while we strengthen our commitment to judgment, ethics, and the world.",Computers,,,179.0,2019-10-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uemvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,artificial intelligence,Beginner,Theory

The Economics of Artificial Intelligence,"Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi Goldfarb, Catherine Tucker","A timely investigation of the potential economic effects, both realized and unrealized, of artificial intelligence within the United States healthcare system. In sweeping conversations about the impact of artificial intelligence on many sectors of the economy, healthcare has received relatively little attention. Yet it seems unlikely that an industry that represents nearly one-fifth of the economy could escape the efficiency and cost-driven disruptions of AI. The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: Health Care Challenges brings together contributions from health economists, physicians, philosophers, and scholars in law, public health, and machine learning to identify the primary barriers to entry of AI in the healthcare sector. Across original papers and in wide-ranging responses, the contributors analyze barriers of four types: incentives, management, data availability, and regulation. They also suggest that AI has the potential to improve outcomes and lower costs. Understanding both the benefits of and barriers to AI adoption is essential for designing policies that will affect the evolution of the healthcare system.",Business & Economics,,,172.0,2024-03-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IOzwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,artificial intelligence,Beginner,Theory
Artificial Intelligence,Melanie Mitchell,"“After reading Mitchell’s guide, you’ll know what you don’t know and what other people don’t know, even though they claim to know it. And that’s invaluable.” —The New York Times A leading computer scientist brings human sense to the AI bubble. No recent scientific enterprise has proved as alluring, terrifying, and filled with extravagant promise and frustrating setbacks as artificial intelligence. The award-winning author Melanie Mitchell, a leading computer scientist, now reveals AI’s turbulent history and the recent spate of apparent successes, grand hopes, and emerging fears surrounding it. In Artificial Intelligence, Mitchell turns to the most urgent questions concerning AI today: How intelligent—really—are the best AI programs? How do they work? What can they actually do, and when do they fail? How humanlike do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us? Along the way, she introduces the dominant models of modern AI and machine learning, describing cutting-edge AI programs, their human inventors, and the historical lines of thought underpinning recent achievements. She meets with fellow experts such as Douglas Hofstadter, the cognitive scientist and Pulitzer Prize–winning author of the modern classic Gödel, Escher, Bach, who explains why he is “terrified” about the future of AI. She explores the profound disconnect between the hype and the actual achievements in AI, providing a clear sense of what the field has accomplished and how much further it has to go. Interweaving stories about the science of AI and the people behind it, Artificial Intelligence brims with clear-sighted, captivating, and accessible accounts of the most interesting and provocative modern work in the field, flavored with Mitchell’s humor and personal observations. This frank, lively book is an indispensable guide to understanding today’s AI, its quest for “human-level” intelligence, and its impact on the future for us all.",Computers,,,216.0,2019-10-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=65iEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,artificial intelligence,Beginner,Theory

The Democratization of Artificial Intelligence,Andreas Sudmann,"After a long time of neglect, Artificial Intelligence is once again at the center of most of our political, economic, and socio-cultural debates. Recent advances in the field of Artifical Neural Networks have led to a renaissance of dystopian and utopian speculations on an AI-rendered future. Algorithmic technologies are deployed for identifying potential terrorists through vast surveillance networks, for producing sentencing guidelines and recidivism risk profiles in criminal justice systems, for demographic and psychographic targeting of bodies for advertising or propaganda, and more generally for automating the analysis of language, text, and images.

The AI Advantage,Thomas H. Davenport,"Cutting through the hype, a practical guide to using artificial intelligence for business benefits and competitive advantage. In The AI Advantage, Thomas Davenport offers a guide to using artificial intelligence in business. He describes what technologies are available and how companies can use them for business benefits and competitive advantage. He cuts through the hype of the AI craze—remember when it seemed plausible that IBM's Watson could cure cancer?—to explain how businesses can put artificial intelligence to work now, in the real world. His key recommendation: don't go for the “moonshot” (curing cancer, or synthesizing all investment knowledge); look for the “low-hanging fruit” to make your company more efficient. Davenport explains that the business value AI offers is solid rather than sexy or splashy. AI will improve products and processes and make decisions better informed—important but largely invisible tasks. AI technologies won't replace human workers but augment their capabilities, with smart machines to work alongside smart people. AI can automate structured and repetitive work; provide extensive analysis of data through machine learning (“analytics on steroids”), and engage with customers and employees via chatbots and intelligent agents. Companies should experiment with these technologies and develop their own expertise. Davenport describes the major AI technologies and explains how they are being used, reports on the AI work done by large commercial enterprises like Amazon and Google, and outlines strategies and steps to becoming a cognitive corporation.

Doing AI,Richard Heimann,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has captured our imaginations—and become a distraction. Too many leaders embrace the oversized narratives of artificial minds outpacing human intelligence and lose sight of the original problems they were meant to solve. When businesses try to “do AI,” they place an abstract solution before problems and customers without fully considering whether it is wise, whether the hype is true, or how AI will impact their organization in the long term. Often absent is sound reasoning for why they should go down this path in the first place. Doing AI explores AI for what it actually is—and what it is not— and the problems it can truly solve. In these pages, author Richard Heimann unravels the tricky relationship between problems and high-tech solutions, exploring the pitfalls in solution-centric thinking and explaining how businesses should rethink AI in a way that aligns with their cultures, goals, and values. As the Chief AI Officer at Cybraics Inc., Richard Heimann knows from experience that AI-specific strategies are often bad for business. Doing AI is his comprehensive guide that will help readers understand AI, avoid common pitfalls, and identify beneficial applications for their companies.

The Age of A.I.,"Henry A Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, Daniel Huttenlocher","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming human society fundamentally and profoundly. Not since the Enlightenment and the Age of Reason have we changed how we approach knowledge, politics, economics, even warfare. Three of our most accomplished and deep thinkers come together to explore what it means for us all. An A.I. that learned to play chess discovered moves that no human champion would have conceived of. Driverless cars edge forward at red lights, just like impatient humans, and so far, nobody can explain why it happens. Artificial intelligence is being put to use in sports, medicine, education, and even (frighteningly) how we wage war. In this book, three of our most accomplished and deep thinkers come together to explore how A.I. could affect our relationship with knowledge, impact our worldviews, and change society and politics as profoundly as the ideas of the Enlightenment.",Political Science,,,0.0,2021-09-14,http://books.google.com/books?id=48IgEAAAQBAJ&dq=AI&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory

Human-centered AI,Ben Shneiderman,"The remarkable progress in algorithms for machine and deep learning have opened the doors to new opportunities, and some dark possibilities. However, a bright future awaits those who build on their working methods by including HCAI strategies of design and testing. As many technology companies and thought leaders have argued, the goal is not to replace people, but to empower them by making design choices that give humans control over technology. In Human-Centered AI, Professor Ben Shneiderman offers an optimistic realist's guide to how artificial intelligence can be used to augment and enhance humans' lives. This project bridges the gap between ethical considerations and practical realities to offer a road map for successful, reliable systems. Digital cameras, communications services, and navigation apps are just the beginning.

Human + Machine,"Paul R. Daugherty, H. James Wilson","AI is radically transforming business. Are you ready? Look around you. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a futuristic notion. It's here right now--in software that senses what we need, supply chains that ""think"" in real time, and robots that respond to changes in their environment. Twenty-first-century pioneer companies are already using AI to innovate and grow fast. The bottom line is this: Businesses that understand how to harness AI can surge ahead. Those that neglect it will fall behind. Which side are you on? In Human + Machine, Accenture leaders Paul R. Daugherty and H. James (Jim) Wilson show that the essence of the AI paradigm shift is the transformation of all business processes within an organization--whether related to breakthrough innovation, everyday customer service, or personal productivity habits. As humans and smart machines collaborate ever more closely, work processes become more fluid and adaptive, enabling companies to change them on the fly--or to completely reimagine them. AI is changing all the rules of how companies operate. Based on the authors' experience and research with 1,500 organizations, the book reveals how companies are using the new rules of AI to leap ahead on innovation and profitability, as well as what you can do to achieve similar results. It describes six entirely new types of hybrid human + machine roles that every company must develop, and it includes a ""leader’s guide"" with the five crucial principles required to become an AI-fueled business. Human + Machine provides the missing and much-needed management playbook for success in our new age of AI. BOOK PROCEEDS FOR THE AI GENERATION The authors' goal in publishing Human + Machine is to help executives, workers, students and others navigate the changes that AI is making to business and the economy. They believe AI will bring innovations that truly improve the way the world works and lives. However, AI will cause disruption, and many people will need education, training and support to prepare for the newly created jobs. To support this need, the authors are donating the royalties received from the sale of this book to fund education and retraining programs focused on developing fusion skills for the age of artificial intelligence.",Computers,,,268.0,2018-03-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wpY4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory
T-Minus AI,Michael Kanaan,"Late in 2017, the global significance of the conversation about artificial intelligence (AI) changed forever. China put the world on alert when it released a plan to dominate all aspects of AI across the planet. Only weeks later, Vladimir Putin raised a Russian red flag in response by declaring AI the future for all humankind, and proclaiming that, ""Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world."" The race was on. Consistent with their unique national agendas, countries throughout the world began plotting their paths and hurrying their pace. Now, not long after, the race has become a sprint. Despite everything at stake, to most of us AI remains shrouded by a cloud of mystery and misunderstanding. Hidden behind complicated and technical jargon and confused by fantastical depictions of science fiction, the modern realities of AI and its profound implications are hard to decipher, but crucial to recognize. In T-Minus AI: Humanity's Countdown to Artificial Intelligence and the New Pursuit of Global Power, author Michael Kanaan explains AI from a human-oriented perspective we can all finally understand. A recognized national expert and the U.S. Air Force's first Chairperson for Artificial Intelligence, Kanaan weaves a compelling new view on our history of innovation and technology to masterfully explain what each of us should know about modern computing, AI, and machine learning. Kanaan also dives into the global implications of AI by illuminating the cultural and national vulnerabilities already exposed and the pressing issues now squarely on the table. AI has already become China's all-purpose tool to impose its authoritarian influence around the world. Russia, playing catch up, is weaponizing AI through its military systems and now infamous, aggressive efforts to disrupt democracy by whatever disinformation means possible. America and like-minded nations are awakening to these new realities—and the paths they're electing to follow echo loudly the political foundations and, in most cases, the moral imperatives upon which they were formed. As we march toward a future far different than ever imagined, T-Minus AI is fascinating and crucially well-timed. It leaves the fiction behind, paints the alarming implications of AI for what they actually are, and calls for unified action to protect fundamental human rights and dignities for all.",Science,,,253.0,2020-08-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kSzJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory
Competing in the Age of AI,"Marco Iansiti, Karim R. Lakhani","In industry after industry, data, analytics, and AI-driven processes are transforming the nature of work. While we often still treat AI as the domain of a specific skill, business function, or sector, we have entered a new era in which AI is challenging the very concept of the firm. AI-centric organizations exhibit a new operating architecture, redefining how they create, capture, share, and deliver value. Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani show how reinventing the firm around data, analytics, and AI removes traditional constraints on scale, scope, and learning that have constrained business growth for hundreds of years. From Airbnb to Ant Financial, Microsoft to Amazon, research shows how AI-driven processes are vastly more scalable than traditional processes, drive massive scope increase, enabling companies to straddle industry boundaries, and enable powerful opportunities for learning--to drive ever more accurate, complex, and sophisticated predictions. When traditional operating constraints are removed, strategy becomes a whole new game, one whose rules and likely outcomes this book will make clear. Iansiti and Lakhani: Present a framework for rethinking business and operating models Explain how ""collisions"" between AI-driven/digital and traditional/analog firms are reshaping competition and altering the structure of our economy Show how these collisions force traditional companies to change their operating models to drive scale, scope, and learning Explain the risks involved in operating model transformation and how to overcome them Describe the new challenges and responsibilities for the leaders of these firms Packed with examples--including the most powerful and innovative global, AI-driven competitors--and based on research in hundreds of firms across many sectors, this is the essential guide for rethinking how your firm competes and operates in the era of AI.",Business & Economics,,,256.0,2020-01-07,http://books.google.com/books?id=yW87wQEACAAJ&dq=AI&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory

MY FIRST A.I. BOOK - Artificial Intelligence and Learning,"Nicky Roberts, Tshilidzi Marwala","Artificial Intelligence and Learning is a teaser in a series of books and pioneering book for kids on Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) which focuses on its chief concept: LEARNING. The My First A.I. Books Series introduces kids of all ages to the foundational concepts for Artificial Intelligence and the 4th Industrial/Human Revolution, AKA I4.0 or 4IR or IOT. Written by three global experts and active scientific researchers, Professors Fernando Buarque (Ph.D. in A.I. Imperial College London), Tshilidzi Marwala (Ph.D. in A.I. at University of Cambridge), and Nicky Roberts (Ph.D. in Mathematics Education at the University of Witwatersrand).This book and series are suitable for all kids starting their Artificial Intelligence journey. As a matter of fact, the future of humankind depends centrally on how A.I. will be produced and used. As such, little readers are encouraged to think and talk in an informed manner about A.I. topics. The story of this first book, sets the plot by delving into the evolution of human tools (up to the fourth human revolution), types of learning, the ingredients for adaptive computer programs (i.e. programs that are able to learn), and even provides a working definition of A.I. All the books of the series are packed with concepts and encourage inquiry. They aim to widen the kids' perspectives on, and also nurture their participation with, these new concepts and tools. All that in this amazing unfolding revolution - the Revolution of the Intelligence. The authors took care to include not only technical concepts, but humanistic and character-building values too. Thus, readers would acquire a good foundation for their future, which may even not be a technical one (but certainly will include A.I.). Ideally, this book should be read by the kids with an adult. It is handsomely complemented by five more books, which portrait five missions, detailing other chief functional A.I. concepts. In each mission the explorers are challenged to delve (and learn) five different ways of using A.I. on real-world problems. The other books in the My First A.I. Books Series are: -My First A.I.

Artificial Intelligence for a Better Future,Bernd Carsten Stahl,"This open access book proposes a novel approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics. AI offers many advantages: better and faster medical diagnoses, improved business processes and efficiency, and the automation of boring work. But undesirable and ethically problematic consequences are possible too: biases and discrimination, breaches of privacy and security, and societal distortions such as unemployment, economic exploitation and weakened democratic processes. There is even a prospect, ultimately, of super-intelligent machines replacing humans. The key question, then, is: how can we benefit from AI while addressing its ethical problems? This book presents an innovative answer to the question by presenting a different perspective on AI and its ethical consequences. Instead of looking at individual AI techniques, applications or ethical issues, we can understand AI as a system of ecosystems, consisting of numerous interdependent technologies, applications and stakeholders. Developing this idea, the book explores how AI ecosystems can be shaped to foster human flourishing. Drawing on rich empirical insights and detailed conceptual analysis, it suggests practical measures to ensure that AI is used to make the world a better place.",Computers,,,124.0,2021-03-18,http://books.google.com/books?id=d6YszgEACAAJ&dq=AI&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory

Artificial Unintelligence,Meredith Broussard,"A software developer’s misadventures in computer programming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence reveal why we should never assume technology always get it right. In Artificial Unintelligence, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally—hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners—that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology—and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right. Making a case against technochauvinism—the belief that technology is always the solution—Broussard argues that it’s just not true that social problems would inevitably retreat before a digitally enabled Utopia. To prove her point, she undertakes a series of adventures in computer programming. She goes for an alarming ride in a driverless car, concluding “the cyborg future is not coming any time soon”; uses artificial intelligence to investigate why students can’t pass standardized tests; deploys machine learning to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster; and attempts to repair the U.S. campaign finance system by building AI software. If we understand the limits of what we can do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we should do with it to make the world better for everyone.",Computers,,,247.0,2018-04-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KJtXDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory
The Artist in the Machine,Arthur I. Miller,"An authority on creativity introduces us to AI-powered computers that are creating art, literature, and music that may well surpass the creations of humans. Today's computers are composing music that sounds “more Bach than Bach,” turning photographs into paintings in the style of Van Gogh's Starry Night, and even writing screenplays. But are computers truly creative—or are they merely tools to be used by musicians, artists, and writers? In this book, Arthur I. Miller takes us on a tour of creativity in the age of machines. Miller, an authority on creativity, identifies the key factors essential to the creative process, from “the need for introspection” to “the ability to discover the key problem.” He talks to people on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, encountering computers that mimic the brain and machines that have defeated champions in chess, Jeopardy!, and Go. In the central part of the book, Miller explores the riches of computer-created art, introducing us to artists and computer scientists who have, among much else, unleashed an artificial neural network to create a nightmarish, multi-eyed dog-cat; taught AI to imagine; developed a robot that paints; created algorithms for poetry; and produced the world's first computer-composed musical, Beyond the Fence, staged by Android Lloyd Webber and friends. But, Miller writes, in order to be truly creative, machines will need to step into the world. He probes the nature of consciousness and speaks to researchers trying to develop emotions and consciousness in computers. Miller argues that computers can already be as creative as humans—and someday will surpass us. But this is not a dystopian account; Miller celebrates the creative possibilities of artificial intelligence in art, music, and literature.",Computers,,,429.0,2020-11-10,http://books.google.com/books?id=FOsCEAAAQBAJ&dq=AI&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory

Deep Learning,"Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville","An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives. “Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.” —Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

"Common Sense, the Turing Test, and the Quest for Real AI",Hector J. Levesque,"What artificial intelligence can tell us about the mind and intelligent behavior. What can artificial intelligence teach us about the mind? If AI's underlying concept is that thinking is a computational process, then how can computation illuminate thinking? It's a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the buzziest AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer systems that learn intelligent behavior from massive amounts of data. This is what powers a driverless car, for example. In this book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to “good old fashioned artificial intelligence,” which is based not on heaps of data but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind of artificial intelligence is equipped to handle situations that depart from previous patterns—as we do in real life, when, for example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when the barista informs us there's no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that passes the famous Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he proposes another way to test for intelligence—the Winograd Schema Test, developed by Levesque and his colleagues. “If our goal is to understand intelligent behavior, we had better understand the difference between making it and faking it,” he observes. He identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the capacity to call on background knowledge: the ability to represent objects of thought symbolically. As AI migrates more and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems without common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.",Computers,,,190.0,2018-03-09,http://books.google.com/books?id=0Z4LEAAAQBAJ&dq=AI&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory
Making Sense of AI,Anthony Elliott,"Industrial robots, self-driving cars, customer-service chatbots and Google’s algorithmic predictions have brought the topic of artificial intelligence into public debate. Why is AI the source of such intense controversy and what are its economic, political, social and cultural consequences? Tracing the changing fortunes of artificial intelligence, Elliott develops a systematic account of how automated intelligent machines impact different spheres and aspects of public and private life. Among the issues discussed are the automation of workforces, surveillance capitalism, warfare and lethal autonomous weapons, the spread of racist robots and the automation of social inequalities. Elliott also considers the decisive role of AI in confronting global risks and social futures, including global pandemics such as COVID-19, and how smart algorithms are impacting the search for energy security and combating climate change.

AI and the Future of Creative Work,Michael Filimowicz,"This book focuses on the intelligent technologies that are transforming creative practices and industries. The future of creative work will be more complicated than “the robots will take our jobs.” The workplace is becoming increasingly hybridized, with human and computational labor complementing each other. Some economic roles for the former will no doubt fade over time, while new roles are created to produce artificial intelligence (AI)-related technologies and implementations for productivity. New tools for the generation and personalization of content across platforms will be as ubiquitous as the automation of repetitive tasks in content creation workflows. Cultural conceptions of what it means to be a creative worker will necessarily change as a result of these transformations in human-machine labor. The volume covers the possibilities of humans and robots developing collegial relationships, creative cybernetics as machines and artists become co-creators of art, the reconcentration of corporate power as AI transforms the music industry, the rhetoric of algorithm-driven cultural production in streaming media and how artisans provide a model of counter-hegemony to automation processes. Scholars and students from many backgrounds, as well as policy makers, journalists and the general reading public, will find a multidisciplinary approach to questions posed by creative labor and industry research from communication, philosophy, robotics, media, music and the creative arts, informatics, information science, and computer science and engineering.",Social Science,,,111.0,2023-05-26,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K1G_EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,AI,Beginner,Theory

Machine Learning,Phil Bernstein,"‘The advent of machine learning-based AI systems demands that our industry does not just share toys, but builds a new sandbox in which to play with them.’ - Phil Bernstein The profession is changing. A new era is rapidly approaching when computers will not merely be instruments for data creation, manipulation and management, but, empowered by artificial intelligence, they will become agents of design themselves. Architects need a strategy for facing the opportunities and threats of these emergent capabilities or risk being left behind. Architecture’s best-known technologist, Phil Bernstein, provides that strategy. Divided into three key sections – Process, Relationships and Results – Machine Learning lays out an approach for anticipating, understanding and managing a world in which computers often augment, but may well also supplant, knowledge workers like architects.

Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book (ISLP) covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python.

Choosing Chinese Universities,Alice Y.C. Te,"This book unpacks the complex dynamics of Hong Kong students’ choice in pursuing undergraduate education at the universities of Mainland China. Drawing on an empirical study based on interviews with 51 students, this book investigates how macro political/economic factors, institutional influences, parental influence, and students’ personal motivations have shaped students’ eventual choice of university. Building on Perna’s integrated model of college choice and Lee’s push-pull mobility model, this book conceptualizes that students’ border crossing from Hong Kong to Mainland China for higher education is a trans-contextualized negotiated choice under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle. The findings reveal that during the decision-making process, influencing factors have conditioned four archetypes of student choice: Pragmatists, Achievers, Averages, and Underachievers. The book closes by proposing an enhanced integrated model of college choice that encompasses both rational motives and sociological factors, and examines the theoretical significance and practical implications of the qualitative study. With its focus on student choice and experiences of studying in China, this book’s research and policy findings will interest researchers, university administrators, school principals, and teachers.",Education,,,0.0,2022-10-07,http://books.google.com/books?id=ddbezwEACAAJ&dq=machine+learning&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,machine learning,Beginner,Theory

But in their fourth and final year, good-natured rivalries turn ugly, and on opening night real violence invades the students’ world of make-believe. In the morning, the fourth-years find themselves facing their very own tragedy, and their greatest acting challenge yet: convincing the police, each other, and themselves that they are innocent. If We Were Villains was named one of Bustle's Best Thriller Novels of the Year, and Mystery Scene says, ""A well-written and gripping ode to the stage...A fascinating, unorthodox take on rivalry, friendship, and truth.""",Fiction,,,368.0,2017-04-11,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=negZDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,ML,Beginner,Theory

Advanced Molecular Genetics,"Alfred Pühler, Kenneth N. Timmis","The development of powerful new techniques and refmements of tech niques in molecular genetics in recent years, and the surge in interest in biotechnology based on genetic methods, have heralded a new golden age in molecular genetics, and stimulated in diverse disciplines much interest in the technologies themselves and their potential uses in basic and applied biomedical sciences. Although some excellent specialist laboratory manuals (especially the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory manuals by I. H. Miller; R. W. Davies et al. ; and T. Maniatis et al. ) on certain chapters of molecular genetics exist, no general text that covers a broad spectrum of the sub ject has thus far been published. The purpose of this manual is to pre sent most, though of necessity not all of the important methods of molecular genetics, in a series of simple experiments, many of which can be readily accomplished by the microbiologist, biochemist or biotechnologist that has had only limited exposure to genetics. The remainder of the experiments require either greater familiarity with the subject, or guidance by someone with such experience. The book should, therefore, not only enable individuals to acquire new proce dures for ongoing projects, but also serve as a basis for the teaching of molecular genetic techniques in formal predoctoral and postdoctoral laboratory courses.",Science,,,353.0,2012-12-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PzHvCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,ML,Advanced,Practice

The Ethical Algorithm,"Michael Kearns, Aaron Roth","Over the course of a generation, algorithms have gone from mathematical abstractions to powerful mediators of daily life. Algorithms have made our lives more efficient, more entertaining, and, sometimes, better informed. At the same time, complex algorithms are increasingly violating the basic rights of individual citizens. Allegedly anonymized datasets routinely leak our most sensitive personal information; statistical models for everything from mortgages to college admissions reflect racial and gender bias. Meanwhile, users manipulate algorithms to ""game"" search engines, spam filters, online reviewing services, and navigation apps. Understanding and improving the science behind the algorithms that run our lives is rapidly becoming one of the most pressing issues of this century. Traditional fixes, such as laws, regulations and watchdog groups, have proven woefully inadequate. Reporting from the cutting edge of scientific research, The Ethical Algorithm offers a new approach: a set of principled solutions based on the emerging and exciting science of socially aware algorithm design. Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth explain how we can better embed human principles into machine code - without halting the advance of data-driven scientific exploration. Weaving together innovative research with stories of citizens, scientists, and activists on the front lines, The Ethical Algorithm offers a compelling vision for a future, one in which we can better protect humans from the unintended impacts of algorithms while continuing to inspire wondrous advances in technology.",Computers,,,229.0,2019-10-04,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wZOzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,ML,Beginner,Theory

Novel Psychoactive Drugs,"Liana Fattore, Aviv Weinstein","An increasing number of novel psychoactive drugs are currently available and sold as 'legal highs' or 'research chemicals'. These New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) constitute a broad range of hundreds of natural and synthetic drugs, including synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, synthetic opioids and other classes, which use has resulted in a significantly growing number of intoxication and mortality, as reported by emergency and poison centres from all over the world. Definition of “NPS” includes any substance that has recently become available and has been designed purposely to replace illegal drugs, although not necessarily of new synthesis. Use of NPS is dramatically increased in the last decade and represents a serious risk for the public health. Their ever-evolving chemical structure, the possibility to distribute in real time through the Internet and social networks information about their use and effects have dramatically challenged public health and drug policies internationally. NPS recently attracted great attention, but most are still unregulated and proposed online as legal alternatives to traditional illicit drugs. Unfortunately, this area is still poorly investigated and very limited information are available so far on their nature and potential risks. The phenomenon of NPS requires multi-national and multi-disciplinary collaborations to improve our knowledge on this changing drug market, to share information and define good practices at a global level. Political and educational efforts are indispensable to regulate this mutable scenario and to inform the public about health consequences of NPS use. Clinicians and emergency staff should be aware that NPS may cause severe health consequences and unexpected adverse effects, and be informed on how to recognized and treat specific intoxication cases. Considering the widespread use of NPS and paucity of information about their toxicology and pharmacology, this Research Topic will be useful to understand the new trends in the scenario of drug use, abuse and addiction to inform professionals and general public about the health problems caused by NPS and to help drug-control policies to adopt suitable control measures.",,,,196.0,2019-06-05,http://books.google.com/books?id=2pGbDwAAQBAJ&dq=ML&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,ML,Beginner,Theory
Introduction to Deep Learning,Eugene Charniak,"A project-based guide to the basics of deep learning. This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of artificial intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. “I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,” the author writes, and the book reflects this approach. Each chapter includes a programming project, exercises, and references for further reading.

The Deep Learning Revolution,Terrence J. Sejnowski,"How deep learning—from Google Translate to driverless cars to personal cognitive assistants—is changing our lives and transforming every sector of the economy. The deep learning revolution has brought us driverless cars, the greatly improved Google Translate, fluent conversations with Siri and Alexa, and enormous profits from automated trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deep learning networks can play poker better than professional poker players and defeat a world champion at Go. In this book, Terry Sejnowski explains how deep learning went from being an arcane academic field to a disruptive technology in the information economy. Sejnowski played an important role in the founding of deep learning, as one of a small group of researchers in the 1980s who challenged the prevailing logic-and-symbol based version of AI. The new version of AI Sejnowski and others developed, which became deep learning, is fueled instead by data. Deep networks learn from data in the same way that babies experience the world, starting with fresh eyes and gradually acquiring the skills needed to navigate novel environments. Learning algorithms extract information from raw data; information can be used to create knowledge; knowledge underlies understanding; understanding leads to wisdom. Someday a driverless car will know the road better than you do and drive with more skill; a deep learning network will diagnose your illness; a personal cognitive assistant will augment your puny human brain. It took nature many millions of years to evolve human intelligence; AI is on a trajectory measured in decades.

The theory and algorithms of neural networks are particularly important for understanding important concepts, so that one can understand the important design concepts of neural architectures in different applications. Why do neural networks work? When do they work better than off-the-shelf machine-learning models? When is depth useful? Why is training neural networks so hard? What are the pitfalls? The book is also rich in discussing different applications in order to give the practitioner a flavor of how neural architectures are designed for different types of problems. Applications associated with many different areas like recommender systems, machine translation, image captioning, image classification, reinforcement-learning based gaming, and text analytics are covered. The chapters of this book span three categories: The basics of neural networks: Many traditional machine learning models can be understood as special cases of neural networks. An emphasis is placed in the first two chapters on understanding the relationship between traditional machine learning and neural networks. Support vector machines, linear/logistic regression, singular value decomposition, matrix factorization, and recommender systems are shown to be special cases of neural networks. These methods are studied together with recent feature engineering methods like word2vec. Fundamentals of neural networks: A detailed discussion of training and regularization is provided in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapters 5 and 6 present radial-basis function (RBF) networks and restricted Boltzmann machines. Advanced topics in neural networks: Chapters 7 and 8 discuss recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks. Several advanced topics like deep reinforcement learning, neural Turing machines, Kohonen self-organizing maps, and generative adversarial networks are introduced in Chapters 9 and 10. The book is written for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners. Numerous exercises are available along with a solution manual to aid in classroom teaching.

Deep Learning,"Siddhartha Bhattacharyya, Vaclav Snasel, Aboul Ella Hassanien, B. K. Tripathy, Satadal Saha","This book will focus on the fundamentals of deep learning along with reporting on the current state-of-art research on deep learning. In addition, it would provide an insight of deep neural networks in action with illustrative coding examples. Moreover, the book will also provide video demonstrations on each chapter. Deep learning is a new area of machine learning research, which has been introduced with the objective of moving ML closer to one of its original goals, i.e. artificial intelligence. Deep learning was developed as an ML approach to deal with complex input-output mappings. While traditional methods successfully solve problems where final value is a simple function of input data, deep learning techniques are able to capture composite relations between non immediately related fields, for example between air pressure recordings and english words, millions of pixels and textual description, brand-related news and future stock prices and almost all real world problems. Deep learning is a class of nature inspired machine learning algorithms that uses a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. The learning may be supervised (e.g., classification) and/or unsupervised (e.g., pattern analysis) manners. These algorithms learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction by resorting to some form of gradient descent for training via backpropagation. Layers that have been used in deep learning include hidden layers of an artificial neural network and sets of propositional formulas. They may also include latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep boltzmann machines. Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and human action recognition.

Geometry of Deep Learning,Jong Chul Ye,"The focus of this book is on providing students with insights into geometry that can help them understand deep learning from a unified perspective. Rather than describing deep learning as an implementation technique, as is usually the case in many existing deep learning books, here, deep learning is explained as an ultimate form of signal processing techniques that can be imagined. To support this claim, an overview of classical kernel machine learning approaches is presented, and their advantages and limitations are explained. Following a detailed explanation of the basic building blocks of deep neural networks from a biological and algorithmic point of view, the latest tools such as attention, normalization, Transformer, BERT, GPT-3, and others are described. Here, too, the focus is on the fact that in these heuristic approaches, there is an important, beautiful geometric structure behind the intuition that enables a systematic understanding. A unified geometric analysis to understand the working mechanism of deep learning from high-dimensional geometry is offered. Then, different forms of generative models like GAN, VAE, normalizing flows, optimal transport, and so on are described from a unified geometric perspective, showing that they actually come from statistical distance-minimization problems. Because this book contains up-to-date information from both a practical and theoretical point of view, it can be used as an advanced deep learning textbook in universities or as a reference source for researchers interested in acquiring the latest deep learning algorithms and their underlying principles.

Talking Nets,"James A. Anderson, Edward Rosenfeld","Surprising tales from the scientists who first learned how to use computers to understand the workings of the human brain. Since World War II, a group of scientists has been attempting to understand the human nervous system and to build computer systems that emulate the brain's abilities. Many of the early workers in this field of neural networks came from cybernetics; others came from neuroscience, physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, psychology, even economics. In this collection of interviews, those who helped to shape the field share their childhood memories, their influences, how they became interested in neural networks, and what they see as its future. The subjects tell stories that have been told, referred to, whispered about, and imagined throughout the history of the field. Together, the interviews form a Rashomon-like web of reality. Some of the mythic people responsible for the foundations of modern brain theory and cybernetics, such as Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Frank Rosenblatt, appear prominently in the recollections. The interviewees agree about some things and disagree about more. Together, they tell the story of how science is actually done, including the false starts, and the Darwinian struggle for jobs, resources, and reputation. Although some of the interviews contain technical material, there is no actual mathematics in the book. Contributors James A.

An Introduction to Neural Networks,James A. Anderson,"An Introduction to Neural Networks falls into a new ecological niche for texts. Based on notes that have been class-tested for more than a decade, it is aimed at cognitive science and neuroscience students who need to understand brain function in terms of computational modeling, and at engineers who want to go beyond formal algorithms to applications and computing strategies. It is the only current text to approach networks from a broad neuroscience and cognitive science perspective, with an emphasis on the biology and psychology behind the assumptions of the models, as well as on what the models might be used for. It describes the mathematical and computational tools needed and provides an account of the author's own ideas. Students learn how to teach arithmetic to a neural network and get a short course on linear associative memory and adaptive maps. They are introduced to the author's brain-state-in-a-box (BSB) model and are provided with some of the neurobiological background necessary for a firm grasp of the general subject. The field now known as neural networks has split in recent years into two major groups, mirrored in the texts that are currently available: the engineers who are primarily interested in practical applications of the new adaptive, parallel computing technology, and the cognitive scientists and neuroscientists who are interested in scientific applications. As the gap between these two groups widens, Anderson notes that the academics have tended to drift off into irrelevant, often excessively abstract research while the engineers have lost contact with the source of ideas in the field. Neuroscience, he points out, provides a rich and valuable source of ideas about data representation and setting up the data representation is the major part of neural network programming. Both cognitive science and neuroscience give insights into how this can be done effectively: cognitive science suggests what to compute and neuroscience suggests how to compute it.",Computers,4.0,3.0,680.0,1995,http://books.google.com/books?id=_ib4vPdB76gC&dq=neural+networks&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,neural networks,Beginner,Theory

Izhikevich","This book is devoted to an analysis of general weakly connected neural networks (WCNNs) that can be written in the form (0.1) m Here, each Xi E IR is a vector that summarizes all physiological attributes of the ith neuron, n is the number of neurons, Ii describes the dynam ics of the ith neuron, and gi describes the interactions between neurons. The small parameter € indicates the strength of connections between the neurons. Weakly connected systems have attracted much attention since the sec ond half of seventeenth century, when Christian Huygens noticed that a pair of pendulum clocks synchronize when they are attached to a light weight beam instead of a wall. The pair of clocks is among the first weakly connected systems to have been studied. Systems of the form (0.1) arise in formal perturbation theories developed by Poincare, Liapunov and Malkin, and in averaging theories developed by Bogoliubov and Mitropolsky.",Mathematics,,,404.0,2012-12-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VmvgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,neural networks,Advanced,Theory

Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition,Albert Nigrin,"In a simple and accessible way it extends embedding field theory into areas of machine intelligence that have not been clearly dealt with before. Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition takes the pioneering work in artificial neural networks by Stephen Grossberg and his colleagues to a new level. In a simple and accessible way it extends embedding field theory into areas of machine intelligence that have not been clearly dealt with before. Following a tutorial of existing neural networks for pattern classification, Nigrin expands on these networks to present fundamentally new architectures that perform realtime pattern classification of embedded and synonymous patterns and that will aid in tasks such as vision, speech recognition, sensor fusion, and constraint satisfaction. Nigrin presents the new architectures in two stages. First he presents a network called Sonnet 1 that already achieves important properties such as the ability to learn and segment continuously varied input patterns in real time, to process patterns in a context sensitive fashion, and to learn new patterns without degrading existing categories. He then removes simplifications inherent in Sonnet 1 and introduces radically new architectures. These architectures have the power to classify patterns that may have similar meanings but that have different external appearances (synonyms). They also have been designed to represent patterns in a distributed fashion, both in short-term and long-term memory.",Computers,,,450.0,1993,http://books.google.com/books?id=_Ltl7VoUJD0C&dq=neural+networks&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,neural networks,Advanced,Theory
Neural Networks,Doug Alexander,"""With respect to the ever-increasing developments in artificial intelligence and artificial neural network applications in different scopes such as medicine, industry, biology, history, military industries, recognition science, space, machine learning and etc., Neural Networks: History and Applications first discusses a comprehensive investigation of artificial neural networks. Next, the authors focus on studies carried out with the artificial neural network approach on the emotion recognition from 2D facial expressions between 2009 and 2019. The major objective of this study is to review, identify, evaluate and analyze the performance of artificial neural network models in emotion recognition applications. This compilation also proposes a simple nonlinear approach for dipole mode index prediction where past values of dipole mode index were used as inputs, and future values were predicted by artificial neural networks. The study was also conducted for seasonal dipole mode index prediction because the dipole mode index is more prominent in the Sep-Oct-Nov season. A subsequent study focuses on how mammography has a high false negative and false positive rate. As such, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been commercialized to help in micro-calcification detection and malignancy differentiation. Yet, little has been explored in differentiating breast cancers with artificial neural networks, one example of computer-aided diagnosis systems. The authors aim to bridge this gap in research. The penultimate chapter reviews the general conditions under which synaptic plasticity most effectively takes place to support the supervised learning of a precise temporal code. Then, the accuracy of each plasticity rule with respect to its temporal encoding precision is examined, and the maximum number of input patterns it can memorize using the precise timings of individual spikes as an indicator of storage capacity in different control and recognition tasks is explored.

"Graph Neural Networks: Foundations, Frontiers, and Applications","Lingfei Wu, Peng Cui, Jian Pei, Liang Zhao","Deep Learning models are at the core of artificial intelligence research today. It is well known that deep learning techniques are disruptive for Euclidean data, such as images or sequence data, and not immediately applicable to graph-structured data such as text. This gap has driven a wave of research for deep learning on graphs, including graph representation learning, graph generation, and graph classification. The new neural network architectures on graph-structured data (graph neural networks, GNNs in short) have performed remarkably on these tasks, demonstrated by applications in social networks, bioinformatics, and medical informatics. Despite these successes, GNNs still face many challenges ranging from the foundational methodologies to the theoretical understandings of the power of the graph representation learning. This book provides a comprehensive introduction of GNNs. It first discusses the goals of graph representation learning and then reviews the history, current developments, and future directions of GNNs. The second part presents and reviews fundamental methods and theories concerning GNNs while the third part describes various frontiers that are built on the GNNs.

Neural Networks and Animal Behavior,"Magnus Enquist, Stefano Ghirlanda","How can we make better sense of animal behavior by using what we know about the brain? This is the first book that attempts to answer this important question by applying neural network theory. Scientists create Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to make models of the brain. These networks mimic the architecture of a nervous system by connecting elementary neuron-like units into networks in which they stimulate or inhibit each other's activity in much the same way neurons do. This book shows how scientists can employ ANNs to analyze animal behavior, explore the general principles of the nervous systems, and test potential generalizations among species. The authors focus on simple neural networks to show how ANNs can be investigated by math and by computers. They demonstrate intuitive concepts that make the operation of neural networks more accessible to nonspecialists. The first chapter introduces various approaches to animal behavior and provides an informal introduction to neural networks, their history, and their potential advantages. The second chapter reviews artificial neural networks, including biological foundations, techniques, and applications. The following three chapters apply neural networks to such topics as learning and development, classical instrumental condition, and the role of genes in building brain networks.

Bayesian Nonparametrics via Neural Networks,Herbert K. H.

Its goal is to demystify neural networks, putting them firmly in a statistical context rather than treating them as a black box. This approach is in contrast to existing books, which tend to treat neural networks as a machine learning algorithm instead of a statistical model. Once this underlying statistical model is recognized, other standard statistical techniques can be applied to improve the model. The Bayesian approach allows better accounting for uncertainty. This book covers uncertainty in model choice and methods to deal with this issue, exploring a number of ideas from statistics and machine learning. A detailed discussion on the choice of prior and new noninformative priors is included, along with a substantial literature review.

Neural Networks in Optimization,Xiang-Sun Zhang,"People are facing more and more NP-complete or NP-hard problems of a combinatorial nature and of a continuous nature in economic, military and management practice. There are two ways in which one can enhance the efficiency of searching for the solutions of these problems. The first is to improve the speed and memory capacity of hardware. We all have witnessed the computer industry's amazing achievements with hardware and software developments over the last twenty years. On one hand many computers, bought only a few years ago, are being sent to elementary schools for children to learn the ABC's of computing. On the other hand, with economic, scientific and military developments, it seems that the increase of intricacy and the size of newly arising problems have no end. We all realize then that the second way, to design good algorithms, will definitely compensate for the hardware limitations in the case of complicated problems. It is the collective and parallel computation property of artificial neural net works that has activated the enthusiasm of researchers in the field of computer science and applied mathematics. It is hard to say that artificial neural networks are solvers of the above-mentioned dilemma, but at least they throw some new light on the difficulties we face. We not only anticipate that there will be neural computers with intelligence but we also believe that the research results of artificial neural networks might lead to new algorithms on von Neumann's computers.",Science,,,369.0,2013-03-09,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_iLaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,neural networks,Advanced,Theory
Semi-Supervised Learning,"Olivier Chapelle, Bernhard Scholkopf, Alexander Zien","A comprehensive review of an area of machine learning that deals with the use of unlabeled data in classification problems: state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, applications, benchmark experiments, and directions for future research. In the field of machine learning, semi-supervised learning (SSL) occupies the middle ground, between supervised learning (in which all training examples are labeled) and unsupervised learning (in which no label data are given). Interest in SSL has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images, text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research.Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments. Finally, the book looks at interesting directions for SSL research.

Introduction to Semi-Supervised Learning,"Xiaojin Zhu, Andrew Goldberg","Semi-supervised learning is a learning paradigm concerned with the study of how computers and natural systems such as humans learn in the presence of both labeled and unlabeled data. Traditionally, learning has been studied either in the unsupervised paradigm (e.g., clustering, outlier detection) where all the data are unlabeled, or in the supervised paradigm (e.g., classification, regression) where all the data are labeled. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to understand how combining labeled and unlabeled data may change the learning behavior, and design algorithms that take advantage of such a combination. Semi-supervised learning is of great interest in machine learning and data mining because it can use readily available unlabeled data to improve supervised learning tasks when the labeled data are scarce or expensive. Semi-supervised learning also shows potential as a quantitative tool to understand human category learning, where most of the input is self-evidently unlabeled. In this introductory book, we present some popular semi-supervised learning models, including self-training, mixture models, co-training and multiview learning, graph-based methods, and semi-supervised support vector machines. For each model, we discuss its basic mathematical formulation. The success of semi-supervised learning depends critically on some underlying assumptions. We emphasize the assumptions made by each model and give counterexamples when appropriate to demonstrate the limitations of the different models. In addition, we discuss semi-supervised learning for cognitive psychology. Finally, we give a computational learning theoretic perspective on semi-supervised learning, and we conclude the book with a brief discussion of open questions in the field.

Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning,Norbert M. Seel,"Over the past century, educational psychologists and researchers have posited many theories to explain how individuals learn, i.e. how they acquire, organize and deploy knowledge and skills. The 20th century can be considered the century of psychology on learning and related fields of interest (such as motivation, cognition, metacognition etc.) and it is fascinating to see the various mainstreams of learning, remembered and forgotten over the 20th century and note that basic assumptions of early theories survived several paradigm shifts of psychology and epistemology. Beyond folk psychology and its naïve theories of learning, psychological learning theories can be grouped into some basic categories, such as behaviorist learning theories, connectionist learning theories, cognitive learning theories, constructivist learning theories, and social learning theories. Learning theories are not limited to psychology and related fields of interest but rather we can find the topic of learning in various disciplines, such as philosophy and epistemology, education, information science, biology, and – as a result of the emergence of computer technologies – especially also in the field of computer sciences and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, machine learning struck a chord in the 1980s and became an important field of the learning sciences in general. As the learning sciences became more specialized and complex, the various fields of interest were widely spread and separated from each other; as a consequence, even presently, there is no comprehensive overview of the sciences of learning or the central theoretical concepts and vocabulary on which researchers rely. The Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning provides an up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the specific terms mostly used in the sciences of learning and its related fields, including relevant areas of instruction, pedagogy, cognitive sciences, and especially machine learning and knowledge engineering. This modern compendium will be an indispensable source of information for scientists, educators, engineers, and technical staff active in all fields of learning. More specifically, the Encyclopedia provides fast access to the most relevant theoretical terms provides up-to-date, broad and authoritative coverage of the most important theories within the various fields of the learning sciences and adjacent sciences and communication technologies; supplies clear and precise explanations of the theoretical terms, cross-references to related entries and up-to-date references to important research and publications.

Although the details of biological evolution are not completely understood (even nowadays), there exist some points supported by strong experimental evidence: • Evolution is a process operating over chromosomes rather than over organisms. The former are organic tools encoding the structure of a living being, i.e., a cr- ture is “built” decoding a set of chromosomes. • Natural selection is the mechanism that relates chromosomes with the ef ciency of the entity they represent, thus allowing that ef cient organism which is we- adapted to the environment to reproduce more often than those which are not. • The evolutionary process takes place during the reproduction stage. There exists a large number of reproductive mechanisms in Nature. Most common ones are mutation (that causes the chromosomes of offspring to be different to those of the parents) and recombination (that combines the chromosomes of the parents to produce the offspring). Based upon the features above, the three mentioned models of evolutionary c- puting were independently (and almost simultaneously) developed.",Technology & Engineering,4.5,2.0,453.0,2007-10-24,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wonrLjj2GagC&source=gbs_api,supervised learning,Beginner,Theory

GANs for Data Augmentation in Healthcare,"Arun Solanki, Mohd Naved","Computer-Assisted Diagnostics (CAD) using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has become an important technology in the medical industry, improving the accuracy of diagnostics. However, the lack Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data leads to the failure of the depth study algorithm. Medical records are often different because of the cost of obtaining information and the time spent consuming the information. In general, clinical data is unreliable and therefore the training of neural network methods to distribute disease across classes does not yield the desired results. Data augmentation is often done by training data to solve problems caused by augmentation tasks such as scaling, cropping, flipping, padding, rotation, translation, affine transformation, and color augmentation techniques such as brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue. Data Augmentation and Segmentation imaging using GAN can be used to provide clear images of brain, liver, chest, abdomen, and liver on an MRI. In addition, GAN shows strong promise in the field of clinical image synthesis. In many cases, clinical evaluation is limited by a lack of data and/or the cost of actual information. GAN can overcome these problems by enabling scientists and clinicians to work on beautiful and realistic images. This can improve diagnosis, prognosis, and disease. Finally, GAN highlights the potential for location of patient information within the data. This is a beneficial clinical application of GAN because it can effectivelyprotect patient confidentiality.

"Lifelong Machine Learning, Second Edition","Zhiyuan Chen, Bing Liu","Lifelong Machine Learning, Second Edition is an introduction to an advanced machine learning paradigm that continuously learns by accumulating past knowledge that it then uses in future learning and problem solving. In contrast, the current dominant machine learning paradigm learns in isolation: given a training dataset, it runs a machine learning algorithm on the dataset to produce a model that is then used in its intended application. It makes no attempt to retain the learned knowledge and use it in subsequent learning. Unlike this isolated system, humans learn effectively with only a few examples precisely because our learning is very knowledge-driven: the knowledge learned in the past helps us learn new things with little data or effort. Lifelong learning aims to emulate this capability, because without it, an AI system cannot be considered truly intelligent. Research in lifelong learning has developed significantly in the relatively short time since the first edition of this book was published. The purpose of this second edition is to expand the definition of lifelong learning, update the content of several chapters, and add a new chapter about continual learning in deep neural networks—which has been actively researched over the past two or three years. A few chapters have also been reorganized to make each of them more coherent for the reader. Moreover, the authors want to propose a unified framework for the research area. Currently, there are several research topics in machine learning that are closely related to lifelong learning—most notably, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning—because they also employ the idea of knowledge sharing and transfer. This book brings all these topics under one roof and discusses their similarities and differences. Its goal is to introduce this emerging machine learning paradigm and present a comprehensive survey and review of the important research results and latest ideas in the area. This book is thus suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, or pattern recognition.

Active Lighting and Its Application for Computer Vision,"Katsushi Ikeuchi, Yasuyuki Matsushita, Ryusuke Sagawa, Hiroshi Kawasaki, Yasuhiro Mukaigawa, Ryo Furukawa, Daisuke Miyazaki","This book describes active illumination techniques in computer vision. We can classify computer vision techniques into two classes: passive and active techniques. Passive techniques observe the scene statically and analyse it as is. Active techniques give the scene some actions and try to facilitate the analysis. In particular, active illumination techniques project specific light, for which the characteristics are known beforehand, to a target scene to enable stable and accurate analysis of the scene. Traditional passive techniques have a fundamental limitation. The external world surrounding us is three-dimensional; the image projected on a retina or an imaging device is two-dimensional. That is, reduction of one dimension has occurred. Active illumination techniques compensate for the dimensional reduction by actively controlling the illumination. The demand for reliable vision sensors is rapidly increasing in many application areas, such as robotics and medical image analysis. This book explains this new endeavour to explore the augmentation of reduced dimensions in computer vision. This book consists of three parts: basic concepts, techniques, and applications. The first part explains the basic concepts for understanding active illumination techniques. In particular, the basic concepts of optics are explained so that researchers and engineers outside the field can understand the later chapters. The second part explains currently available active illumination techniques, covering many techniques developed by the authors. The final part shows how such active illumination techniques can be applied to various domains, describing the issue to be overcome by active illumination techniques and the advantages of using these techniques. This book is primarily aimed at 4th year undergraduate and 1st year graduate students, and will also help engineers from fields beyond computer vision to use active illumination techniques.

Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning,Csaba Szepesvári,"Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize a numerical performance measure that expresses a long-term objective. What distinguishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the algorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book, we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming. We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.

Combined with the deep neural networks, deep RL become so powerful that many complicated systems can be automatically managed by AI agents at a superhuman level. On the other hand, CPSs are envisioned to revolutionize our society in the near future. Such examples include the emerging smart buildings, intelligent transportation, and electric grids. However, the conventional hand-programming controller in CPSs could neither handle the increasing complexity of the system, nor automatically adapt itself to new situations that it has never encountered before. The problem of how to apply the existing deep RL algorithms, or develop new RL algorithms to enable the real-time adaptive CPSs, remains open. This book aims to establish a linkage between the two domains by systematically introducing RL foundations and algorithms, each supported by one or a few state-of-the-art CPS examples to help readers understand the intuition and usefulness of RL techniques. Features Introduces reinforcement learning, including advanced topics in RL Applies reinforcement learning to cyber-physical systems and cybersecurity Contains state-of-the-art examples and exercises in each chapter Provides two cybersecurity case studies Reinforcement Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems with Cybersecurity Case Studies is an ideal text for graduate students or junior/senior undergraduates in the fields of science, engineering, computer science, or applied mathematics.

Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Feedback Control,"Rushikesh Kamalapurkar, Patrick Walters, Joel Rosenfeld, Warren Dixon","Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Feedback Control develops model-based and data-driven reinforcement learning methods for solving optimal control problems in nonlinear deterministic dynamical systems. In order to achieve learning under uncertainty, data-driven methods for identifying system models in real-time are also developed. The book illustrates the advantages gained from the use of a model and the use of previous experience in the form of recorded data through simulations and experiments. The book’s focus on deterministic systems allows for an in-depth Lyapunov-based analysis of the performance of the methods described during the learning phase and during execution. To yield an approximate optimal controller, the authors focus on theories and methods that fall under the umbrella of actor–critic methods for machine learning. They concentrate on establishing stability during the learning phase and the execution phase, and adaptive model-based and data-driven reinforcement learning, to assist readers in the learning process, which typically relies on instantaneous input-output measurements. This monograph provides academic researchers with backgrounds in diverse disciplines from aerospace engineering to computer science, who are interested in optimal reinforcement learning functional analysis and functional approximation theory, with a good introduction to the use of model-based methods.

Reinforcement Learning and Dynamic Programming Using Function Approximators,"Lucian Busoniu, Robert Babuska, Bart De Schutter, Damien Ernst","From household appliances to applications in robotics, engineered systems involving complex dynamics can only be as effective as the algorithms that control them. While Dynamic Programming (DP) has provided researchers with a way to optimally solve decision and control problems involving complex dynamic systems, its practical value was limited by algorithms that lacked the capacity to scale up to realistic problems. However, in recent years, dramatic developments in Reinforcement Learning (RL), the model-free counterpart of DP, changed our understanding of what is possible. Those developments led to the creation of reliable methods that can be applied even when a mathematical model of the system is unavailable, allowing researchers to solve challenging control problems in engineering, as well as in a variety of other disciplines, including economics, medicine, and artificial intelligence. Reinforcement Learning and Dynamic Programming Using Function Approximators provides a comprehensive and unparalleled exploration of the field of RL and DP. With a focus on continuous-variable problems, this seminal text details essential developments that have substantially altered the field over the past decade. In its pages, pioneering experts provide a concise introduction to classical RL and DP, followed by an extensive presentation of the state-of-the-art and novel methods in RL and DP with approximation. Combining algorithm development with theoretical guarantees, they elaborate on their work with illustrative examples and insightful comparisons. Three individual chapters are dedicated to representative algorithms from each of the major classes of techniques: value iteration, policy iteration, and policy search. The features and performance of these algorithms are highlighted in extensive experimental studies on a range of control applications. The recent development of applications involving complex systems has led to a surge of interest in RL and DP methods and the subsequent need for a quality resource on the subject. For graduate students and others new to the field, this book offers a thorough introduction to both the basics and emerging methods. And for those researchers and practitioners working in the fields of optimal and adaptive control, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and operations research, this resource offers a combination of practical algorithms, theoretical analysis, and comprehensive examples that they will be able to adapt and apply to their own work.

"Rollout, Policy Iteration, and Distributed Reinforcement Learning",Dimitri Bertsekas,"The purpose of this book is to develop in greater depth some of the methods from the author's Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control recently published textbook (Athena Scientific, 2019). In particular, we present new research, relating to systems involving multiple agents, partitioned architectures, and distributed asynchronous computation. We pay special attention to the contexts of dynamic programming/policy iteration and control theory/model predictive control. We also discuss in some detail the application of the methodology to challenging discrete/combinatorial optimization problems, such as routing, scheduling, assignment, and mixed integer programming, including the use of neural network approximations within these contexts. The book focuses on the fundamental idea of policy iteration, i.e., start from some policy, and successively generate one or more improved policies. If just one improved policy is generated, this is called rollout, which, based on broad and consistent computational experience, appears to be one of the most versatile and reliable of all reinforcement learning methods. In this book, rollout algorithms are developed for both discrete deterministic and stochastic DP problems, and the development of distributed implementations in both multiagent and multiprocessor settings, aiming to take advantage of parallelism. Approximate policy iteration is more ambitious than rollout, but it is a strictly off-line method, and it is generally far more computationally intensive. This motivates the use of parallel and distributed computation. One of the purposes of the monograph is to discuss distributed (possibly asynchronous) methods that relate to rollout and policy iteration, both in the context of an exact and an approximate implementation involving neural networks or other approximation architectures. Much of the new research is inspired by the remarkable AlphaZero chess program, where policy iteration, value and policy networks, approximate lookahead minimization, and parallel computation all play an important role.",Computers,,,498.0,2021-08-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hbo-EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,reinforcement learning,Advanced,Theory
TEXPLORE: Temporal Difference Reinforcement Learning for Robots and Time-Constrained Domains,Todd Hester,"This book presents and develops new reinforcement learning methods that enable fast and robust learning on robots in real-time. Robots have the potential to solve many problems in society, because of their ability to work in dangerous places doing necessary jobs that no one wants or is able to do. One barrier to their widespread deployment is that they are mainly limited to tasks where it is possible to hand-program behaviors for every situation that may be encountered. For robots to meet their potential, they need methods that enable them to learn and adapt to novel situations that they were not programmed for. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm for learning sequential decision making processes and could solve the problems of learning and adaptation on robots. This book identifies four key challenges that must be addressed for an RL algorithm to be practical for robotic control tasks. These RL for Robotics Challenges are: 1) it must learn in very few samples; 2) it must learn in domains with continuous state features; 3) it must handle sensor and/or actuator delays; and 4) it should continually select actions in real time. This book focuses on addressing all four of these challenges. In particular, this book is focused on time-constrained domains where the first challenge is critically important. In these domains, the agent’s lifetime is not long enough for it to explore the domains thoroughly, and it must learn in very few samples.",Technology & Engineering,,,170.0,2013-06-22,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SuK5BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,reinforcement learning,Advanced,Theory

The Ethics of AI and Robotics,Soraj Hongladarom,"Artificial intelligence is the most discussed and arguably the most powerful technology in the world today. The very rapid development of the technology, and its power to change the world, and perhaps even ourselves, calls for a serious and systematic thinking about its ethical and social implications, as well as how its development should be directed. The present book offers a new perspective on how such a direction should take place, based on insights obtained from the age-old tradition of Buddhist teaching. The book argues that any kind of ethical guidelines for AI and robotics must combine two kinds of excellence together, namely the technical and the ethical. The machine needs to aspire toward the status of ethical perfection, whose idea was laid out in detail by the Buddha more than two millennia ago. It is this standard of ethical perfection, called “machine enlightenment,” that gives us a view toward how an effective ethical guideline should be made. This ideal is characterized by the realization that all things are interdependent, and by the commitment to alleviate all beings from suffering, in other words by two of the quintessential Buddhist values. The book thus contributes to a concern for a norm for ethical guidelines for AI that is both practical and cross-cultural.",Religion,,,237.0,2020-08-20,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MprzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,AI ethics,Beginner,Theory

Bots and Beasts,Paul Thagard,"An expert on mind considers how animals and smart machines measure up to human intelligence. Octopuses can open jars to get food, and chimpanzees can plan for the future. An IBM computer named Watson won on Jeopardy! and Alexa knows our favorite songs. But do animals and smart machines really have intelligence comparable to that of humans? In Bots and Beasts, Paul Thagard looks at how computers (""bots"") and animals measure up to the minds of people, offering the first systematic comparison of intelligence across machines, animals, and humans. Thagard explains that human intelligence is more than IQ and encompasses such features as problem solving, decision making, and creativity. He uses a checklist of twenty characteristics of human intelligence to evaluate the smartest machines--including Watson, AlphaZero, virtual assistants, and self-driving cars--and the most intelligent animals--including octopuses, dogs, dolphins, bees, and chimpanzees. Neither a romantic enthusiast for nonhuman intelligence nor a skeptical killjoy, Thagard offers a clear assessment. He discusses hotly debated issues about animal intelligence concerning bacterial consciousness, fish pain, and dog jealousy. He evaluates the plausibility of achieving human-level artificial intelligence and considers ethical and policy issues.

The Machine Question,David J. Gunkel,"An investigation into the assignment of moral responsibilities and rights to intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making. One of the enduring concerns of moral philosophy is deciding who or what is deserving of ethical consideration. Much recent attention has been devoted to the ""animal question""—consideration of the moral status of nonhuman animals. In this book, David Gunkel takes up the ""machine question"": whether and to what extent intelligent and autonomous machines of our own making can be considered to have legitimate moral responsibilities and any legitimate claim to moral consideration. The machine question poses a fundamental challenge to moral thinking, questioning the traditional philosophical conceptualization of technology as a tool or instrument to be used by human agents. Gunkel begins by addressing the question of machine moral agency: whether a machine might be considered a legitimate moral agent that could be held responsible for decisions and actions. He then approaches the machine question from the other side, considering whether a machine might be a moral patient due legitimate moral consideration. Finally, Gunkel considers some recent innovations in moral philosophy and critical theory that complicate the machine question, deconstructing the binary agent–patient opposition itself. Technological advances may prompt us to wonder if the science fiction of computers and robots whose actions affect their human companions (think of HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey) could become science fact. Gunkel's argument promises to influence future considerations of ethics, ourselves, and the other entities who inhabit this world.",Philosophy,,,271.0,2017-09-08,http://books.google.com/books?id=w54LEAAAQBAJ&dq=AI+ethics&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI ethics,Advanced,Theory
The Technological Singularity,Murray Shanahan,"The idea of technological singularity, and what it would mean if ordinary human intelligence were enhanced or overtaken by artificial intelligence. The idea that human history is approaching a “singularity”—that ordinary humans will someday be overtaken by artificially intelligent machines or cognitively enhanced biological intelligence, or both—has moved from the realm of science fiction to serious debate. Some singularity theorists predict that if the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to develop at its current dizzying rate, the singularity could come about in the middle of the present century. Murray Shanahan offers an introduction to the idea of the singularity and considers the ramifications of such a potentially seismic event. Shanahan's aim is not to make predictions but rather to investigate a range of scenarios. Whether we believe that singularity is near or far, likely or impossible, apocalypse or utopia, the very idea raises crucial philosophical and pragmatic questions, forcing us to think seriously about what we want as a species. Shanahan describes technological advances in AI, both biologically inspired and engineered from scratch. Once human-level AI—theoretically possible, but difficult to accomplish—has been achieved, he explains, the transition to superintelligent AI could be very rapid. Shanahan considers what the existence of superintelligent machines could mean for such matters as personhood, responsibility, rights, and identity. Some superhuman AI agents might be created to benefit humankind; some might go rogue. (Is Siri the template, or HAL?) The singularity presents both an existential threat to humanity and an existential opportunity for humanity to transcend its limitations. Shanahan makes it clear that we need to imagine both possibilities if we want to bring about the better outcome.",Computers,4.0,1.0,269.0,2015-08-07,http://books.google.com/books?id=rAxZCgAAQBAJ&dq=AI+ethics&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI ethics,Beginner,Theory
Robot Rights,David J. Gunkel,"A provocative attempt to think about what was previously considered unthinkable: a serious philosophical case for the rights of robots. We are in the midst of a robot invasion, as devices of different configurations and capabilities slowly but surely come to take up increasingly important positions in everyday social reality—self-driving vehicles, recommendation algorithms, machine learning decision making systems, and social robots of various forms and functions. Although considerable attention has already been devoted to the subject of robots and responsibility, the question concerning the social status of these artifacts has been largely overlooked. In this book, David Gunkel offers a provocative attempt to think about what has been previously regarded as unthinkable: whether and to what extent robots and other technological artifacts of our own making can and should have any claim to moral and legal standing. In his analysis, Gunkel invokes the philosophical distinction (developed by David Hume) between “is” and “ought” in order to evaluate and analyze the different arguments regarding the question of robot rights. In the course of his examination, Gunkel finds that none of the existing positions or proposals hold up under scrutiny. In response to this, he then offers an innovative alternative proposal that effectively flips the script on the is/ought problem by introducing another, altogether different way to conceptualize the social situation of robots and the opportunities and challenges they present to existing moral and legal systems.",Philosophy,,,253.0,2024-03-19,http://books.google.com/books?id=dIfzEAAAQBAJ&dq=AI+ethics&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI ethics,Beginner,Theory
Heartificial Intelligence,John Havens,"Algorithms will soon know more about us than we know ourselves Where should machine automation end? Is it acceptable to have a digital assistant arrange your calendar, but not to have a robot spouse? Are companion robots acceptable for seniors in need of comfort, but not okay for toddlers exposed to emotional software that could influence their behavior? Is it desirable to live a life within the virtual reality of Facebook’s Oculus Rift, but not if your thoughts are sold to advertisers who manipulate your purchases? We’ve entered an era where a myriad of personalization algorithms influence our every decision, and the lines between human assistance, automation, and extinction have blurred. We need to create ethical standards for the Artificial Intelligence usurping our lives, and allow individuals to control their identity based on their values. Otherwise, we sacrifice our humanity for productivity versus purpose and for profits versus people. Featuring pragmatic solutions drawing on economics, emerging technologies, and positive psychology, Heartificial Intelligence provides the first values-driven approach to algorithmic living—a definitive roadmap to help humanity embrace the present and positively define their future. Each chapter opens with a fictional vignette, helping readers imagine how they would respond to various Artificial Intelligence scenarios while demonstrating the need to codify their values, as the algorithms dominating society today are already doing.

The sooner we see them, the better our response.Each chapter starts with a set of signals0́4data we observed that, taken together, helped us to reveal a trend. The impact of new technology on strategy is a theme of the book, and each chapter looks at how organizations are using new technologies to their advantage.The goal is to spark meaningful conversations within organizations: How could we participate in the collaborative economy? What could our CIO and our CMO be doing to drive strategy, innovation, and revenue growth? What could we do to leverage the Internet of Things and intelligent automation as catalysts of invention? Could we use MOOCs as pivots for corporate training, recruiting, and marketing? How might technology transform the manufacturing process, our supply chain, and the knowledge work that we do? Could we take advantage of the renaissance in domestic energy (oil and gas)? What could we be doing to counter cyber crime? What is our organization doing to tune into signals of emerging trends that may be relevant to us?In an environment where the pace of change is accelerating, sensing has become an essential discipline for all organizations. No matter your role in an organization, sensing emerging trends can make you more effective and more valuable in your work.

New Laws of Robotics,Frank Pasquale,"“Essential reading for all who have a vested interest in the rise of AI.” —Daryl Li, AI & Society “Thought-provoking...Explores how we can best try to ensure that robots work for us, rather than against us, and proposes a new set of laws to provide a conceptual framework for our thinking on the subject.” —Financial Times “Pasquale calls for a society-wide reengineering of policy, politics, economics, and labor relations to set technology on a more regulated and egalitarian path...Makes a good case for injecting more bureaucracy into our techno-dreams, if we really want to make the world a better place.” —Wired “Pasquale is one of the leading voices on the uneven and often unfair consequences of AI in our society...Every policymaker should read this book and seek his counsel.” —Safiya Noble, author of Algorithms of Oppression Too many CEOs tell a simple story about the future of work: if a machine can do what you do, your job will be automated, and you will be replaced. They envision everyone from doctors to soldiers rendered superfluous by ever-more-powerful AI. Another story is possible. In virtually every walk of life, robotic systems can make labor more valuable, not less. Frank Pasquale tells the story of nurses, teachers, designers, and others who partner with technologists, rather than meekly serving as data sources for their computerized replacements. This cooperation reveals the kind of technological advance that could bring us all better health care, education, and more, while maintaining meaningful work. These partnerships also show how law and regulation can promote prosperity for all, rather than a zero-sum race of humans against machines. Policymakers must not allow corporations or engineers alone to answer questions about how far AI should be entrusted to assume tasks once performed by humans, or about the optimal mix of robotic and human interaction. The kind of automation we get—and who benefits from it—will depend on myriad small decisions about how to develop AI. Pasquale proposes ways to democratize that decision-making, rather than centralize it in unaccountable firms.

Judicial Applications of Artificial Intelligence,"Giovanni Sartor, L. Karl Branting","The judiciary is in the early stages of a transformation in which AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology will help to make the judicial process faster, cheaper, and more predictable without compromising the integrity of judges' discretionary reasoning. Judicial decision-making is an area of daunting complexity, where highly sophisticated legal expertise merges with cognitive and emotional competence. How can AI contribute to a process that encompasses such a wide range of knowledge, judgment, and experience? Rather than aiming at the impossible dream (or nightmare) of building an automatic judge, AI research has had two more practical goals: producing tools to support judicial activities, including programs for intelligent document assembly, case retrieval, and support for discretionary decision-making; and developing new analytical tools for understanding and modeling the judicial process, such as case-based reasoning and formal models of dialectics, argumentation, and negotiation. Judges, squeezed between tightening budgets and increasing demands for justice, are desperately trying to maintain the quality of their decision-making process while coping with time and resource limitations. Flexible AI tools for decision support may promote uniformity and efficiency in judicial practice, while supporting rational judicial discretion. Similarly, AI may promote flexibility, efficiency and accuracy in other judicial tasks, such as drafting various judicial documents. The contributions in this volume exemplify some of the directions that the AI transformation of the judiciary will take.",Law,,,230.0,2013-04-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=seSoBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,AI applications,Beginner,Theory

Our Final Invention,James Barrat,"Elon Musk named Our Final Invention one of five books everyone should read about the future—a Huffington Post Definitive Tech Book of 2013. Artificial Intelligence helps choose what books you buy, what movies you see, and even who you date. It puts the “smart” in your smartphone and soon it will drive your car. It makes most of the trades on Wall Street, and controls vital energy, water, and transportation infrastructure. But Artificial Intelligence can also threaten our existence. In as little as a decade, AI could match and then surpass human intelligence. Corporations and government agencies are pouring billions into achieving AI’s Holy Grail—human-level intelligence. Once AI has attained it, scientists argue, it will have survival drives much like our own. We may be forced to compete with a rival more cunning, more powerful, and more alien than we can imagine. Through profiles of tech visionaries, industry watchdogs, and groundbreaking AI systems, Our Final Invention explores the perils of the heedless pursuit of advanced AI. Until now, human intelligence has had no rival. Can we coexist with beings whose intelligence dwarfs our own? And will they allow us to? “If you read just one book that makes you confront scary high-tech realities that we’ll soon have no choice but to address, make it this one.” —The Washington Post “Science fiction has long explored the implications of humanlike machines (think of Asimov’s I, Robot), but Barrat’s thoughtful treatment adds a dose of reality.” —Science News “A dark new book . . . lays out a strong case for why we should be at least a little worried.” —The New Yorker",Computers,1.0,3.0,141.0,2013-10-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KQ8zsFhlmg0C&source=gbs_api,advanced AI,Beginner,Theory

On Intelligence,"Jeff Hawkins, Sandra Blakeslee","The inventor of the PalmPilot shares a compelling new theory of intelligence, brain function, and the future of artificial intelligence. Tech innovator Jeff Hawkins reshaped our relationship to computers with devices like the PalmPilot. Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself. In this book, Hawkins develops a powerful theory of human cognition and explains how, based on his theory, we can finally build intelligent machines. According to Hawkins, the brain is a complex system that remembers sequences of events and their nested relationships. This style of organization reflects the true structure of the world and allows us to make increasingly accurate predictions. This memory-prediction process in turn forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness. In an engaging style accessible to the general reader, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of brain function can be applied to building intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.

Interactive Task Learning,"Kevin A. Gluck, John E. Laird","Experts from a range of disciplines explore how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. Humans are not limited to a fixed set of innate or preprogrammed tasks. We learn quickly through language and other forms of natural interaction, and we improve our performance and teach others what we have learned. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of new tasks through natural interaction is an ongoing challenge. Advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics are leading us to future systems with human-like capabilities. A huge gap exists, however, between the highly specialized niche capabilities of current machine learning systems and the generality, flexibility, and in situ robustness of human instruction and learning. Drawing on expertise from multiple disciplines, this Strüngmann Forum Report explores how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. The contributors consider functional knowledge requirements, the ontology of interactive task learning, and the representation of task knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. They explore natural forms of interactions among humans as well as the use of interaction to teach robots and software agents new tasks in complex, dynamic environments. They discuss research challenges and opportunities, including ethical considerations, and make proposals to further understanding of interactive task learning and create new capabilities in assistive robotics, healthcare, education, training, and gaming.

Cambrian Intelligence,Rodney Allen Brooks,"Until the mid-1980s, AI researchers assumed that an intelligent system doing high-level reasoning was necessary for the coupling of perception and action. In this traditional model, cognition mediates between perception and plans of action. Realizing that this core AI, as it was known, was illusory, Rodney A. Brooks turned the field of AI on its head by introducing the behavior-based approach to robotics. The cornerstone of behavior-based robotics is the realization that the coupling of perception and action gives rise to all the power of intelligence and that cognition is only in the eye of an observer. Behavior-based robotics has been the basis of successful applications in entertainment, service industries, agriculture, mining, and the home. It has given rise to both autonomous mobile robots and more recent humanoid robots such as Brooks' Cog. This book represents Brooks' initial formulation of and contributions to the development of the behavior-based approach to robotics.

Demystifying AI for the Enterprise,"Prashant Natarajan, Bob Rogers, Edward Dixon, Jonas Christensen, Kirk Borne, Leland Wilkinson, Shantha Mohan","Artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms –– machine learning, chatbots, robots, agents, etc. –– is increasingly being seen as a core component of enterprise business workflow and information management systems. The current promise and hype around AI are being driven by software vendors, academic research projects, and startups. However, we posit that the greatest promise and potential for AI lies in the enterprise with its applications touching all organizational facets. With increasing business process and workflow maturity, coupled with recent trends in cloud computing, datafication, IoT, cybersecurity, and advanced analytics, there is an understanding that the challenges of tomorrow cannot be solely addressed by today’s people, processes, and products. There is still considerable mystery, hype, and fear about AI in today’s world. A considerable amount of current discourse focuses on a dystopian future that could adversely affect humanity. Such opinions, with understandable fear of the unknown, don’t consider the history of human innovation, the current state of business and technology, or the primarily augmentative nature of tomorrow’s AI. This book demystifies AI for the enterprise. It takes readers from the basics (definitions, state-of-the-art, etc.) to a multi-industry journey, and concludes with expert advice on everything an organization must do to succeed. Along the way, we debunk myths, provide practical pointers, and include best practices with applicable vignettes. AI brings to enterprise the capabilities that promise new ways by which professionals can address both mundane and interesting challenges more efficiently, effectively, and collaboratively (with humans).

Artificial Intelligence,Charles Patton,"""Artificial Consciousness"" is a pioneering exploration of the boundaries between Artificial Intelligence (AI), consciousness, and the potential for overlap. A leading artificial intelligence researcher delves deep into the inherent divide between AI and true consciousness, presenting thought-provoking arguments and unique insights. Artificial intelligence has revolutionized numerous aspects of modern life, from autonomous vehicles to personalized recommendations on streaming platforms. But does AI possess the critical elements of consciousness despite its complexity and seeming intelligence? Is it truly capable of understanding and experiencing reality the way humans do? In this ground-breaking work, the author strives to answer these questions, untangling the intricate threads of AI and consciousness to layout the “roadmap” to creating an Artificial Consciousness (AC). This book meticulously explores AI's current limitations, focusing on its inability to replicate the essential elements of consciousness. It sheds light on why our most sophisticated AI models, despite their impressive capabilities, lack genuine self-awareness, subjective experience, or the ability to empathize.

Deep Learning Systems,Andres Rodriguez,"This book describes deep learning systems: the algorithms, compilers, and processor components to efficiently train and deploy deep learning models for commercial applications. The exponential growth in computational power is slowing at a time when the amount of compute consumed by state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) workloads is rapidly growing. Model size, serving latency, and power constraints are a significant challenge in the deployment of DL models for many applications. Therefore, it is imperative to codesign algorithms, compilers, and hardware to accelerate advances in this field with holistic system-level and algorithm solutions that improve performance, power, and efficiency. Advancing DL systems generally involves three types of engineers: (1) data scientists that utilize and develop DL algorithms in partnership with domain experts, such as medical, economic, or climate scientists; (2) hardware designers that develop specialized hardware to accelerate the components in the DL models; and (3) performance and compiler engineers that optimize software to run more efficiently on a given hardware. Hardware engineers should be aware of the characteristics and components of production and academic models likely to be adopted by industry to guide design decisions impacting future hardware. Data scientists should be aware of deployment platform constraints when designing models. Performance engineers should support optimizations across diverse models, libraries, and hardware targets. The purpose of this book is to provide a solid understanding of (1) the design, training, and applications of DL algorithms in industry; (2) the compiler techniques to map deep learning code to hardware targets; and (3) the critical hardware features that accelerate DL systems. This book aims to facilitate co-innovation for the advancement of DL systems. It is written for engineers working in one or more of these areas who seek to understand the entire system stack in order to better collaborate with engineers working in other parts of the system stack. The book details advancements and adoption of DL models in industry, explains the training and deployment process, describes the essential hardware architectural features needed for today's and future models, and details advances in DL compilers to efficiently execute algorithms across various hardware targets. Unique in this book is the holistic exposition of the entire DL system stack, the emphasis on commercial applications, and the practical techniques to design models and accelerate their performance. The author is fortunate to work with hardware, software, data scientist, and research teams across many high-technology companies with hyperscale data centers. These companies employ many of the examples and methods provided throughout the book.",Computers,,,267.0,2020-10-26,http://books.google.com/books?id=OKAFEAAAQBAJ&dq=AI+systems&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI systems,Advanced,Practice
Conversational Artificial Intelligence,"Romil Rawat, Rajesh Kumar Chakrawarti, Sanjaya Kumar Sarangi, Anand Rajavat, Mary Sowjanya Alamanda, Kotagiri Srividya, K.

It is particularly suited for those that bridge the academic world and industry, allowing readers to understand the security concerns in advanced security solutions for conversational AI in the cloud platform domain by reviewing present and evolving security solutions, their limitations, and future research directions. Conversational AI combines natural language processing (NLP) with traditional software like chatbots, voice assistants, or an interactive voice recognition system to help customers through either a spoken or typed interface. Conversational chatbots that respond to questions promptly and accurately to help customers are a fascinating development since they make the customer service industry somewhat self-sufficient. A well-automated chatbot can decimate staffing needs, but creating one is a time-consuming process. Voice recognition technologies are becoming more critical as AI assistants like Alexa become more popular. Chatbots in the corporate world have advanced technical connections with clients thanks to improvements in artificial intelligence. However, these chatbots’ increased access to sensitive information has raised serious security concerns. Threats are one-time events such as malware and DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) assaults. Targeted strikes on companies are familiar and frequently lock workers out. User privacy violations are becoming more common, emphasizing the dangers of employing chatbots. Vulnerabilities are systemic problems that enable thieves to break in. Vulnerabilities allow threats to enter the system, hence they are inextricably linked. Malicious chatbots are widely used to spam and advertise in chat rooms by imitating human behavior and discussions, or to trick individuals into disclosing personal information like bank account details.",Computers,,,804.0,2024-03-06,http://books.google.com/books?id=5uzzEAAAQBAJ&dq=AI+systems&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI systems,Advanced,Theory
Conversational AI,Michael McTear,"This book provides a comprehensive introduction to Conversational AI. While the idea of interacting with a computer using voice or text goes back a long way, it is only in recent years that this idea has become a reality with the emergence of digital personal assistants, smart speakers, and chatbots. Advances in AI, particularly in deep learning, along with the availability of massive computing power and vast amounts of data, have led to a new generation of dialogue systems and conversational interfaces. Current research in Conversational AI focuses mainly on the application of machine learning and statistical data-driven approaches to the development of dialogue systems. However, it is important to be aware of previous achievements in dialogue technology and to consider to what extent they might be relevant to current research and development. Three main approaches to the development of dialogue systems are reviewed: rule-based systems that are handcrafted using best practice guidelines; statistical data-driven systems based on machine learning; and neural dialogue systems based on end-to-end learning. Evaluating the performance and usability of dialogue systems has become an important topic in its own right, and a variety of evaluation metrics and frameworks are described. Finally, a number of challenges for future research are considered, including: multimodality in dialogue systems, visual dialogue; data efficient dialogue model learning; using knowledge graphs; discourse and dialogue phenomena; hybrid approaches to dialogue systems development; dialogue with social robots and in the Internet of Things; and social and ethical issues.",Computers,,,253.0,2020-10-30,http://books.google.com/books?id=kGAMEAAAQBAJ&dq=AI+systems&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,AI systems,Beginner,Theory

Handbook of Constraint Programming,"Francesca Rossi, Peter van Beek, Toby Walsh","Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, programming languages, and operations research. Constraint programming is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics.The aim of this handbook is to capture the full breadth and depth of the constraint programming field and to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage. While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area.The intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas.The handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful application areas for constraint programming.- Covers the whole field of constraint programming- Survey-style chapters- Five chapters on applications",Computers,3.0,1.0,977.0,2006-08-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kjap9ZWcKOoC&source=gbs_api,AI programming,Advanced,Theory
Constraint Programming,"Brian Mayoh, Enn Tyugu, Jaan Penjam","Constraint programming is like an octopus spreading its tentacles into databases, operations research, artificial intelligence, and many other areas. The concept of constraint programming was introduced in artificial intelligence and graphics in the 1960s and 1970s. Now the related techniques are used and studied in many fields of computing. Different aspects of constraint processing are investigated in theoretical computer science, logic programming, knowledge representation, operations research, and related application domains. Constraint programming has been included in the lists of related topics of many conferences. Nevertheless, only in 1993 were the first forums held, devoted as a whole to this field of knowledge. These were the First Workshop on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (PPCP'93) which was held in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, April 28-30, the International Workshop on Constraint Processing (at CSAM'93) held in St. Petersburg, Russia, July 20-21, and the NATO Advanced Study Institute (NATO AS!) on Constraint Programming held in Parnu, Estonia, August 13-24. NATO A Sis are aimed to be schools bringing together leading researchers and practitioners from industry and academia in some area of knowledge to provide a concise picture of the work done and results obtained by different groups.

Explainable AI with Python,"Leonida Gianfagna, Antonio Di Cecco","This book provides a full presentation of the current concepts and available techniques to make “machine learning” systems more explainable. The approaches presented can be applied to almost all the current “machine learning” models: linear and logistic regression, deep learning neural networks, natural language processing and image recognition, among the others. Progress in Machine Learning is increasing the use of artificial agents to perform critical tasks previously handled by humans (healthcare, legal and finance, among others). While the principles that guide the design of these agents are understood, most of the current deep-learning models are ""opaque"" to human understanding. Explainable AI with Python fills the current gap in literature on this emerging topic by taking both a theoretical and a practical perspective, making the reader quickly capable of working with tools and code for Explainable AI. Beginning with examples of what Explainable AI (XAI) is and why it is needed in the field, the book details different approaches to XAI depending on specific context and need. Hands-on work on interpretable models with specific examples leveraging Python are then presented, showing how intrinsic interpretable models can be interpreted and how to produce “human understandable” explanations. Model-agnostic methods for XAI are shown to produce explanations without relying on ML models internals that are “opaque.” Using examples from Computer Vision, the authors then look at explainable models for Deep Learning and prospective methods for the future. Taking a practical perspective, the authors demonstrate how to effectively use ML and XAI in science.

Developing Intelligent Agent Systems,"Lin Padgham, Michael Winikoff","Build your own intelligent agent system... Intelligent agent technology is a tool of modern computer science that can be used to engineer complex computer programmes that behave rationally in dynamic and changing environments. Applications range from small programmes that intelligently search the Web buying and selling goods via electronic commerce, to autonomous space probes. This powerful technology is not widely used, however, as developing intelligent agent software requires high levels of training and skill. The authors of this book have developed and tested a methodology and tools for developing intelligent agent systems. With this methodology (Prometheus) developers can start agent-oriented designs and implementations easily from scratch saving valuable time and resources. Developing Intelligent Agent Systems not only answers the questions “what are agents?” and “why are they useful?” but also the crucial question: “how do I design and build intelligent agent systems?” The book covers everything a practitioner needs to know to begin to effectively use this technology - including an introduction to the notion of agents, a description of the concepts involved, and a software engineering methodology.

Advances in the Evolutionary Synthesis of Intelligent Agents,Mukesh Patel,"This book explores a central issue in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and artificial life: how to design information structures and processes that create and adapt intelligent agents through evolution and learning. Among the first uses of the computer was the development of programs to model perception, reasoning, learning, and evolution. Further developments resulted in computers and programs that exhibit aspects of intelligent behavior. The field of artificial intelligence is based on the premise that thought processes can be computationally modeled. Computational molecular biology brought a similar approach to the study of living systems. In both cases, hypotheses concerning the structure, function, and evolution of cognitive systems (natural as well as synthetic) take the form of computer programs that store, organize, manipulate, and use information. Systems whose information processing structures are fully programmed are difficult to design for all but the simplest applications. Real-world environments call for systems that are able to modify their behavior by changing their information processing structures. Cognitive and information structures and processes, embodied in living systems, display many effective designs for biological intelligent agents. They are also a source of ideas for designing artificial intelligent agents. This book explores a central issue in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and artificial life: how to design information structures and processes that create and adapt intelligent agents through evolution and learning. The book is organized around four topics: the power of evolution to determine effective solutions to complex tasks, mechanisms to make evolutionary design scalable, the use of evolutionary search in conjunction with local learning algorithms, and the extension of evolutionary search in novel directions.",Computers,,,510.0,2001,http://books.google.com/books?id=6hLLLFKuBXEC&dq=intelligent+agents&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,intelligent agents,Advanced,Theory

The authors are aware of the dynamics of this research area and its effects when they describe such a fast developing area in a slow, traditional me dium like a book. One thing is sure today: when the book appears on the market, new intelligent agents will already exist and some of the hypotheses made by this book will have been shown to be incorrect.

Agent-Based Hybrid Intelligent Systems,"Zili Zhang (Ph.D.), Chengqi Zhang","Solving complex problems in real-world contexts, such as financial investment planning or mining large data collections, involves many different sub-tasks, each of which requires different techniques. To deal with such problems, a great diversity of intelligent techniques are available, including traditional techniques like expert systems approaches and soft computing techniques like fuzzy logic, neural networks, or genetic algorithms. These techniques are complementary approaches to intelligent information processing rather than competing ones, and thus better results in problem solving are achieved when these techniques are combined in hybrid intelligent systems. Multi-Agent Systems are ideally suited to model the manifold interactions among the many different components of hybrid intelligent systems. This book introduces agent-based hybrid intelligent systems and presents a framework and methodology allowing for the development of such systems for real-world applications.

Building Intelligent Agents,Gheorghe Tecuci,"Building Intelligent Agents is unique in its comprehensive coverage of the subject. The first part of the book presents an original theory for building intelligent agents and a methodology and tool that implement the theory. The second part of the book presents complex and detailed case studies of building different types of agents: an educational assessment agent, a statistical analysis assessment and support agent, an engineering design assistant, and a virtual military commander. Also featured in this book is Disciple, a toolkit for building interactive agents which function in much the same way as a human apprentice. Disciple-based agents can reason both with incomplete information, but also with information that is potentially incorrect. This approach, in which the agent learns its behavior from its teacher, integrates many machine learning and knowledge acquisition techniques, taking advantage of their complementary strengths to compensate for each others weakness. As a consequence, it significantly reduces (or even eliminates) the involvement of a knowledge engineer in the process of building an intelligent agent.",Computers,,,356.0,1998-06-23,http://books.google.com/books?id=_Yjlsii1di4C&dq=intelligent+agents&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,intelligent agents,Advanced,Practice

Socially Intelligent Agents,"Kerstin Dautenhahn, Alan H. Bond, Lola Canamero, Bruce Edmonds","Socially situated planning provides one mechanism for improving the social awareness ofagents. Obviously this work isin the preliminary stages and many of the limitation and the relationship to other work could not be addressed in such a short chapter. The chief limitation, of course, is the strong commitment to de?ning social reasoning solely atthe meta-level, which restricts the subtlety of social behavior. Nonetheless, our experience in some real-world military simulation applications suggest that the approach, even in its preliminary state, is adequate to model some social interactions, and certainly extends the sta- of-the art found in traditional training simulation systems.

An Introduction to MultiAgent Systems,Michael Wooldridge,"The study of multi-agent systems (MAS) focuses on systems in which many intelligent agents interact with each other. These agents are considered to be autonomous entities such as software programs or robots. Their interactions can either be cooperative (for example as in an ant colony) or selfish (as in a free market economy). This book assumes only basic knowledge of algorithms and discrete maths, both of which are taught as standard in the first or second year of computer science degree programmes. A basic knowledge of artificial intelligence would useful to help understand some of the issues, but is not essential. The book’s main aims are: To introduce the student to the concept of agents and multi-agent systems, and the main applications for which they are appropriate To introduce the main issues surrounding the design of intelligent agents To introduce the main issues surrounding the design of a multi-agent society To introduce a number of typical applications for agent technology After reading the book the student should understand: The notion of an agent, how agents are distinct from other software paradigms (e.g. objects) and the characteristics of applications that lend themselves to agent-oriented software The key issues associated with constructing agents capable of intelligent autonomous action and the main approaches taken to developing such agents The key issues in designing societies of agents that can effectively cooperate in order to solve problems, including an understanding of the key types of multi-agent interactions possible in such systems The main application areas of agent-based systems",Computers,4.5,2.0,484.0,2009-06-22,http://books.google.com/books?id=X3ZQ7yeDn2IC&dq=intelligent+agents&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,intelligent agents,Beginner,Theory

Cooperative Agents,"N.J. Saam, B. Schmidt","Agent-based modelling on a computer appears to have a special role to play in the development of social science. It offers a means of discovering general and applicable social theory, and grounding it in precise assumptions and derivations, whilst addressing those elements of individual cognition that are central to human society. However, there are important questions to be asked and difficulties to overcome in achieving this potential. What differentiates agent-based modelling from traditional computer modelling? Which model types should be used under which circumstances? If it is appropriate to use a complex model, how can it be validated? Is social simulation research to adopt a realist epistemology, or can it operate within a social constructionist framework? What are the sociological concepts of norms and norm processing that could either be used for planned implementation or for identifying equivalents of social norms among co-operative agents? Can sustainability be achieved more easily in a hierarchical agent society than in a society of isolated agents? What examples are there of hybrid forms of interaction between humans and artificial agents?

Computational Intelligence in Industry 4.0 and 5.0 Applications,"JOSEPH BAMIDELE AWOTUNDE, Kamalakanta Muduli, BISWAJIT BRAHMA","Industry 4.0 and 5.0 applications will revolutionize production, enabling smart manufacturing machines to interact with their environments. These machines will become self-aware, self-learning, and capable of real-time data interpretation for self-diagnosis and prevention of production issues. They will also self-calibrate and prioritize tasks to enhance production quality and efficiency. Computational Intelligence in Industry 4.0 and 5.0 Applications examines applications that merge three key disciplines: computational intelligence (CI), Industry 4.0, and Industry 5.0. It presents solutions using Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies, augmented by CI-based techniques, modeling, controls, estimations, applications, systems, and future scopes. These applications use data from smart sensors, processed through enhanced CI methods, to make smart automation more effective. Industry 4.0 integrates data and intelligent automation into manufacturing, using technologies like CI, the IoT, the IIoT, and cloud computing. It transforms data into actionable insights for decision-making and process optimization, essential for modern competitive businesses managing high-speed data integration in production processes. Currently, Industries 4.0 and 5.0 are undergoing significant transformations due to advances in applying artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, telecommunication technologies, and control theory. These applications are increasingly multidisciplinary, integrating mechanical, control, and information technologies. However, they face such technical challenges as parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, sensor noise, and mechanical failures. To address these, this book examines such CI technologies as fuzzy logic, neural networks, and reinforcement learning and their application to modeling, control, and estimation. It also covers recent advancements in IIoT sensors, microcontrollers, and big data analytics that further enhance CI-based solutions in Industry 4.0 and 5.0 systems.",Computers,,,425.0,2025-02-06,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9CU2EQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,intelligent agents,Advanced,Practice

The text covers: design of a cooperative protocol to achieve consensus for multivehicle systems, allowing cooperation that is resistant to the effects of packet loss and/or adversarial attack; analysis and synthesis of an event-triggering mechanism for cooperative multivehicle systems over uncertain networks; and the problem of distributed leader-following consensus and methods for compelling multivehicle systems to reach consensus. Throughout the book, cooperation problems are transformed into stability problems. Lyapunov theory is used to guarantee cooperation among agents. The distributed approach is applied to triggering mechanisms, the cooperation process, and the impact of cyber-attacks. Discrete-time analysis shows how the event-based structure can be designed to match the performance of continuous-time counterparts. The book details applications and computer simulation with several practical examples. This book is of interest to a wide audience from the graduate student, through the academic researcher to the industrial practitioner, all of them sharing a common interest in the stability and security of multiagent systems.",Technology & Engineering,,,452.0,2022-03-16,http://books.google.com/books?id=K85kEAAAQBAJ&dq=intelligent+agents&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,intelligent agents,Advanced,Theory

Socially Interactive Agents (SIAs), whether virtually or physically embodied, are autonomous agents that are able to perceive an environment including people or other agents, reason, decide how to interact, and express attitudes such as emotions, engagement, or empathy. They are capable of interacting with people and one another in a socially intelligent manner using multimodal communicative behaviors, with the goal to support humans in various domains. Written by international experts in their respective fields, the book summarizes research in the many important research communities pertinent for SIAs, while discussing current challenges and future directions. The handbook provides easy access to modeling and studying SIAs for researchers and students, and aims at further bridging the gap between the research communities involved. In two volumes, the book clearly structures the vast body of research. The first volume starts by introducing what is involved in SIAs research, in particular research methodologies and ethical implications of developing SIAs. It further examines research on appearance and behavior, focusing on multimodality. Finally, social cognition for SIAs is investigated using different theoretical models and phenomena such as theory of mind or pro-sociality.

Language Modeling for Information Retrieval,"Bruce Croft, John Lafferty","A statisticallanguage model, or more simply a language model, is a prob abilistic mechanism for generating text. Such adefinition is general enough to include an endless variety of schemes. However, a distinction should be made between generative models, which can in principle be used to synthesize artificial text, and discriminative techniques to classify text into predefined cat egories. The first statisticallanguage modeler was Claude Shannon. In exploring the application of his newly founded theory of information to human language, Shannon considered language as a statistical source, and measured how weH simple n-gram models predicted or, equivalently, compressed natural text. To do this, he estimated the entropy of English through experiments with human subjects, and also estimated the cross-entropy of the n-gram models on natural 1 text. The ability of language models to be quantitatively evaluated in tbis way is one of their important virtues. Of course, estimating the true entropy of language is an elusive goal, aiming at many moving targets, since language is so varied and evolves so quickly. Yet fifty years after Shannon's study, language models remain, by all measures, far from the Shannon entropy liInit in terms of their predictive power. However, tbis has not kept them from being useful for a variety of text processing tasks, and moreover can be viewed as encouragement that there is still great room for improvement in statisticallanguage modeling.",Computers,5.0,1.0,272.0,2003-05-31,http://books.google.com/books?id=WTSOtP7XNr0C&dq=large+language+models&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api,large language models,Advanced,Theory

Statistical Language Models for Information Retrieval,ChengXiang Zhai,"As online information grows dramatically, search engines such as Google are playing a more and more important role in our lives. Critical to all search engines is the problem of designing an effective retrieval model that can rank documents accurately for a given query. This has been a central research problem in information retrieval for several decades. In the past ten years, a new generation of retrieval models, often referred to as statistical language models, has been successfully applied to solve many different information retrieval problems. Compared with the traditional models such as the vector space model, these new models have a more sound statistical foundation and can leverage statistical estimation to optimize retrieval parameters. They can also be more easily adapted to model non-traditional and complex retrieval problems. Empirically, they tend to achieve comparable or better performance than a traditional model with less effort on parameter tuning. This book systematically reviews the large body of literature on applying statistical language models to information retrieval with an emphasis on the underlying principles, empirically effective language models, and language models developed for non-traditional retrieval tasks. All the relevant literature has been synthesized to make it easy for a reader to digest the research progress achieved so far and see the frontier of research in this area.

Art in the Age of Machine Learning,Sofian Audry,"An examination of machine learning art and its practice in new media art and music. Over the past decade, an artistic movement has emerged that draws on machine learning as both inspiration and medium. In this book, transdisciplinary artist-researcher Sofian Audry examines artistic practices at the intersection of machine learning and new media art, providing conceptual tools and historical perspectives for new media artists, musicians, composers, writers, curators, and theorists. Audry looks at works from a broad range of practices, including new media installation, robotic art, visual art, electronic music and sound, and electronic literature, connecting machine learning art to such earlier artistic practices as cybernetics art, artificial life art, and evolutionary art. Machine learning underlies computational systems that are biologically inspired, statistically driven, agent-based networked entities that program themselves. Audry explains the fundamental design of machine learning algorithmic structures in terms accessible to the nonspecialist while framing these technologies within larger historical and conceptual spaces. Audry debunks myths about machine learning art, including the ideas that machine learning can create art without artists and that machine learning will soon bring about superhuman intelligence and creativity. Audry considers learning procedures, describing how artists hijack the training process by playing with evaluative functions; discusses trainable machines and models, explaining how different types of machine learning systems enable different kinds of artistic practices; and reviews the role of data in machine learning art, showing how artists use data as a raw material to steer learning systems and arguing that machine learning allows for novel forms of algorithmic remixes.",Art,,,215.0,2021-11-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TjYXEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,large language models,Beginner,Theory

Recommender Systems for Social Tagging Systems,"Leandro Balby Marinho, Andreas Hotho, Robert Jäschke, Alexandros Nanopoulos, Steffen Rendle, Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Gerd Stumme, Panagiotis Symeonidis","Social Tagging Systems are web applications in which users upload resources (e.g., bookmarks, videos, photos, etc.) and annotate it with a list of freely chosen keywords called tags. This is a grassroots approach to organize a site and help users to find the resources they are interested in. Social tagging systems are open and inherently social; features that have been proven to encourage participation. However, with the large popularity of these systems and the increasing amount of user-contributed content, information overload rapidly becomes an issue. Recommender Systems are well known applications for increasing the level of relevant content over the “noise” that continuously grows as more and more content becomes available online. In social tagging systems, however, we face new challenges. While in classic recommender systems the mode of recommendation is basically the resource, in social tagging systems there are three possible modes of recommendation: users, resources, or tags. Therefore suitable methods that properly exploit the different dimensions of social tagging systems data are needed. In this book, we survey the most recent and state-of-the-art work about a whole new generation of recommender systems built to serve social tagging systems. The book is divided into self-contained chapters covering the background material on social tagging systems and recommender systems to the more advanced techniques like the ones based on tensor factorization and graph-based models.",Computers,5.0,1.0,116.0,2012-02-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kP6180ETYVQC&source=gbs_api,recommendation system,Advanced,Theory

Persuasive Recommender Systems,"Kyung-Hyan Yoo, Ulrike Gretzel, Markus Zanker","Whether users are likely to accept the recommendations provided by a recommender system is of utmost importance to system designers and the marketers who implement them. By conceptualizing the advice seeking and giving relationship as a fundamentally social process, important avenues for understanding the persuasiveness of recommender systems open up. Specifically, research regarding influential factors in advice seeking relationships, which is abundant in the context of human-human relationships, can provide an important framework for identifying potential influence factors in recommender system context. This book reviews the existing literature on the factors in advice seeking relationships in the context of human-human, human-computer, and human-recommender system interactions. It concludes that many social cues that have been identified as influential in other contexts have yet to be implemented and tested with respect to recommender systems. Implications for recommender system research and design are discussed.",Computers,,,62.0,2012-08-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gd9HGDSPmPMC&source=gbs_api,recommendation system,Advanced,Theory
